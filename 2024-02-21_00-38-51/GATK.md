# Software Name: Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)
The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a powerful software package developed by the Broad Institute for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data, particularly in the field of genomics.

## Overview:
GATK is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to process and analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, focusing on variant discovery and genotyping. It offers advanced algorithms and methodologies for detecting mutations, indels, and structural variations in DNA or RNA sequences, aiding researchers in understanding genetic variations and disease mechanisms.

## Core Features:
- **Variant Discovery:** Identifies genetic variants such as SNPs, indels, and structural variations.
- **Genotyping:** Determines the genotypes of individuals based on sequencing data.
- **Quality Control:** Performs data preprocessing, variant quality filtering, and base quality recalibration.
- **Functional Annotation:** Annotates variants with biological relevance information.
- **Best Practices Workflows:** Provides standardized analysis workflows for NGS data.
