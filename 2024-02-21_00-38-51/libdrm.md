# Software Name: Direct Rendering Manager (libdrm)
libdrm is a C library that provides a user-space interface for accessing the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) framework used in the Linux operating system for managing graphics rendering.

## Overview:
libdrm serves as a low-level interface to communicate with the kernel modesetting subsystem and graphics hardware. It enables applications to interact with the graphics driver, request modesetting, perform memory management, and access hardware acceleration capabilities, facilitating efficient graphics rendering on Linux systems.

## Core Features:
- **Kernel Modesetting:** Facilitates display configuration and modesetting operations.
- **Buffer Management:** Manages graphics buffers and memory resources.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Enables access to hardware acceleration features.
- **Graphics Driver Interaction:** Provides a communication interface with the graphics driver.
- **Low-Level Graphics Operations:** Supports low-level graphics operations for rendering.
