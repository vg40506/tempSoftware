# Software Name: GNU Make (gmake)
GNU Make, often referred to as "gmake," is a powerful build automation tool that manages the compilation and building of software projects.

## Overview:
GNU Make is widely used in software development to automate the process of building executable programs from source code. It reads a "makefile" that specifies how the project's targets and dependencies are related. By analyzing the dependencies, Make determines the optimal order for building the project components efficiently.

## Core Features:
- **Build Automation:** Automates the compilation and building process of software projects.
- **Dependency Tracking:** Tracks dependencies to determine which components need to be rebuilt.
- **Customization:** Supports the creation of custom rules and build targets in the makefile.
- **Parallel Execution:** Allows for parallel execution of build tasks for faster compilation.
- **Portability:** Available on various platforms, providing a consistent build environment.
