## BEAGLE

BEAGLE is an open-source software package used to analyze genetic variant data. This software is primarily used to perform genotype imputation, pedigree analysis, and haplotyping. The BEAGLE software package can handle large genetic dataset efficiently, making it suitable for use in bioinformatics research.

### Core features:

- **Genotype Imputation**: BEAGLE can statistically infer the missing or untyped genetic variant data in a study.

- **Phase Haplotypes**: It can resolve haplotypes from genotype data. That is, it determines the combination of alleles that are located on the same physical chromosome.

- **Pedigree Analysis**: BEAGLE can analyze family data to compute Mendelian segregation probabilities.

- **Analysis of Large Datasets**: BEAGLE is efficient in analyzing large-scale genetic data, including data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS).

- **Variety of Genetic Data**: It can handle numerous types of genetic data, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs).
