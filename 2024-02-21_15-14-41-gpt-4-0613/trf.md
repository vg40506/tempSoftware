## TRF

TRF, or Tandem Repeats Finder, is a program to analyze DNA sequences. It locates and displays tandem repeats in DNA sequences. This bioinformatics tool is lightweight and is considered to be an integral software in many computational genomic pipelines designed to analyze the functional role of tandem repeats in the genome.

### Core features:

- **Tandem Repeat Analysis**: TRF can identify tandem repeats within given DNA sequences of various sizes.

- **Pattern Recognition Algorithm**: The software employs advanced pattern recognition algorithms to search for tandem repeats.

- **Reporting**: The program reports the location of tandem repeats in the input sequence and provides detailed information about each repeat, including its size, the number of repeats, and more.

- **Sequences Alignment**: TRF can align tandem repeat sequences and calculate consensus sequences.
