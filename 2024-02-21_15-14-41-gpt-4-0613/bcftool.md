## BCFtools

BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. Developed by the team behind SAMtools, these tools are commonly used in bioinformatics workflows dealing with variant calling, filtering, and statistics. These are open-source and freely available utilities.

### Core features:

- **Variant Manipulation**: BCFtools provide options to manipulate variant call formats, allowing sorting, merging, modifying, etc.

- **Calling**: BCFtools includes an algorithm for calling and genotyping likelihoods of polymorphism.

- **Filtering**: BCFtools can be used to apply filters to variant data, potentially removing low-quality or spurious calls.

- **Statistics**: Various utilities within BCFtools can calculate descriptive statistics from variant files.
