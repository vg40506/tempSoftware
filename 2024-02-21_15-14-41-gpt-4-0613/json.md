## JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and a web application, serving as an alternative to XML.

### Core features:

- **Lightweight Data-Interchange Format**: JSON is a compact format, ideal for transmitting data between a server and a web application.

- **Language-Neutral**: JSON can be read and implemented in virtually any modern programming language, making it universally applicable across platforms and projects.

- **Human Readable**: The format of JSON is text only, and it is designed to be human-readable and editable even away from the coding environment.

- **Value types**: JSON supports six data types: null, numbers, strings, boolean, array, and object.

- **Structures**: JSON employs two types of structures - objects (unordered collection of key-value pairs) and arrays (ordered collection of values).
