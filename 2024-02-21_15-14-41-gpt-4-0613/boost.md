## Boost

Boost is a set of high-quality, peer-reviewed, free and open-source libraries for the C++ programming language. These libraries aim to extend the capabilities of C++, providing code that is both efficient and abstract, and raises the productivity and software quality for C++ developers.

### Core features:

- **Standard Library Extensions**: Boost provides extensions for the standard library in areas like algorithms, containers, and functional programming.

- **Meta-programming**: Boost includes heavy use of template metaprogramming, a technique of manipulating combinatorial logic at compile-time.

- **Performance**: Boost libraries are often high-performant and are used in scientific computations and real-time systems.

- **Code Quality**: Boost library submissions undergo rigorously peer-review for quality and compliance with C++ standards.

- **Multi-threading**: Boost offers extensive support for multithreaded programming, with libraries facilitating the design of multithreaded applications.
