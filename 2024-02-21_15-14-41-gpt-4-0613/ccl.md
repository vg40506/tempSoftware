## CCL (Core Cosmology Library)

The Core Cosmology Library (CCL) is a modern, open-source library for cosmological observables, written in C and with a Python interface. It is developed by the LSST DESC (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Dark Energy Science Collaboration) to provide flexible, fast, and transparent cosmological computations. 

### Core features:

- **Cosmological Model Calculations**: CCL provides accurate computations of cosmological models and multiple cosmological observables.

- **Multiple Cosmological Observables**: It supports multiple cosmological observables, including matter power spectrum, lensing power spectrum, and correlation functions.

- **Flexibility and Customization**: Users can customize cosmology, transfer function, and matter power spectrum, among others.

- **High Performance**: CCL is designed for high performance to handle computationally intensive tasks.

- **Community Driven Software**: An open-source project developed and maintained by an active community of developers.
