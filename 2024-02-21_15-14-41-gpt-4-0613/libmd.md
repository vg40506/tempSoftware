## libmd

libmd is an open-source library focused on molecular dynamics for modern C++. This library supports development and maintenance of molecular dynamic software and algorithms. The library provides a framework for simple and productive implementation of molecular models, simulation algorithms, and analysis tools.

### Core features:

- **Molecular Dynamics Framework**: libmd provides biophysical and chemophysical properties that can be modelled using molecular dynamics techniques, such as forces/interactions and particle motions.

- **High-Level Abstractions**: Its high-level abstractions simplify the development of molecular dynamics software. It abstracts complex details and provides a convenient interface to implement new models and algorithms.

- **Optimized for Performance**: The library is highly optimized for computational performance, which is crucial for large-scale molecular simulations.

- **Extensibility**: Users can extend the library with their own code to implement new simulation models and analysis techniques.
