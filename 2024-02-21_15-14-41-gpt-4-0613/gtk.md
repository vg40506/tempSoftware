## GTK

GTK, which stands for The GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites. It's free and open-source software firstly developed by the GNOME community for desktop environments.

### Core features:

- **Widget System**: GTK contains a comprehensive suite of pre-defined graphical elements or widgets such as buttons, text boxes, selection boxes, and more.

- **Multiprocessing**: GTK apps can utilize multithreading and multiprocessing for efficient and responsive handling of user interactions.

- **Event-driven**: Applications made with GTK are event-driven, meaning the application responds to the user inputs like clicking on a button, selecting from a list, etc.

- **Support for Various Languages**: Bind many programming languages primarily for C and includes bindings for Python, Perl, and many other languages.

- **Portable**: Supports a broad range of platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, and has a robust ecosystem with extensive documentation and user communities.
