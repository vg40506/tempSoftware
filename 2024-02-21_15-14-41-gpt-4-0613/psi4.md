## PSI4

PSI4 is an open-source software suite for ab initio quantum chemistry computations. The software is designed to run computations ranging from small to large, providing methods for molecular energies, properties, and gradients to be computed. PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods and performs many types of computations, including various molecular properties, vibrational calculations, and more.

### Core features:

- **Quantum Chemical Computations**: PSI4 can handle a wide range of quantum mechanical computations, including molecular energies, properties, and gradients. 

- **Scalability**: PSI4 is capable of running computations for systems of all sizes, from small molecules to large, biomolecular complexes.

- **Customizable**: PSI4 allows for deep customization of computations through Python scripting. 

- **Plugins**: PSI4 supports both built-in and user-developed plugins which can be used to further expand functionality.

- **Community Developments**: PSI4 is maintained and further developed by an active community of developers and users, ensuring its capabilities are always up-to-date with the latest advances in computational chemistry.
