I'll create a JSON output for GObject:

```json
{
    "software_name": "GObject",
    "overview": "GObject is a fundamental object system library in the GNOME project. It provides a robust and efficient foundation for defining and implementing object-oriented principles in C and C++ applications, enabling object-oriented programming techniques and structures in GNOME software development.",
    "core_features": [
        "Object-oriented system",
        "C/C++ application support",
        "Object model implementation"
    ],
    "general_tags": [
        "GNOME project",
        "Object system library",
        "Object-oriented programming"
    ],
    "research_discipline": [
        "Computer science",
        "Software development"
    ],
    "research_area": [
        "Object-oriented design",
        "Application development"
    ],
    "software_class": "Object system library",
    "software_type": "Programming foundation tool"
}
``` 

Let me know if you need more details or have any specific requirements!
