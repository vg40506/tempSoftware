I'll create a JSON output for FASTQ:

```json
{
    "software_name": "FASTQ",
    "overview": "FASTQ is a text-based file format used to store both biological sequence data and associated quality scores. It is widely utilized in bioinformatics for storing high-throughput sequencing data, including DNA sequences and their corresponding quality values.",
    "core_features": [
        "Sequence data storage",
        "Quality score representation",
        "High-throughput sequencing support"
    ],
    "general_tags": [
        "Bioinformatics",
        "Sequence data format",
        "Sequencing data storage"
    ],
    "research_discipline": [
        "Genomics",
        "Bioinformatics"
    ],
    "research_area": [
        "High-throughput sequencing",
        "Sequence data analysis"
    ],
    "software_class": "Data format",
    "software_type": "Sequence data storage format"
}
``` 

If you need any more details or have specific requirements, feel free to let me know!
