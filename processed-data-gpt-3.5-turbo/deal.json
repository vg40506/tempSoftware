    "comprehensive_overview": "Deal.ii is a C++ software library supporting the creation of finite element codes and a wide range of applications of finite elements.",
    "core_features": "deal.ii provides support for unstructured grid hierarchies in two and three dimensions, and for a wide range of finite elements. The core library includes support for distributed memory and shared memory parallelism, algebraic multigrid solvers, mesh adaptivity, and finite element spaces ranging from low-order linear Lagrange elements to high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods. The core library does not include an abundance of pre-written applications, but rather concentrates on providing commonly necessary functionality in a flexible and efficient framework, allowing the user to solve their particular problem effectively.",
