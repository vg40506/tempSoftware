  "comprehensive_overview": "GL2PS is a C library providing high-quality vector output for any OpenGL application. The main purpose of GL2PS is to create high-resolution vector images from 3D scenes rendered by OpenGL.",
  "core_features": "1. Generates vector output in PostScript and PDF formats.\n2. Supports various features like solid, outlined, and composite polygons; simple polyline; compressed, antialiased, and smooth shaded colors; and text annotations.\n3. Configurable output: users can define line styles, line caps, and line joins.\n4. Compatible with any OpenGL application, making it suitable for scientific visualization, computational geometry, and computer graphics.",
