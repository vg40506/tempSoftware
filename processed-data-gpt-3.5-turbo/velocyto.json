  "tool": "Velocyto",
  "overview": "Velocyto is a computational tool for the analysis of RNA velocity, which aims to estimate the future state of individual cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data. It provides algorithms for inferring the direction and rate of change in gene expression at the single-cell level, offering insights into cellular dynamics and differentiation.",
