    "comprehensive_overview": "CLIP (Cross-Linked Immunoprecipitation) is a technique used to identify the direct binding sites of RNA-binding proteins on RNAs. It involves UV crosslinking of proteins to RNA, followed by immunoprecipitation of the RNA-binding protein of interest and sequencing to identify the binding sites.",
