    "comprehensive_overview": "FlexiBLAS is a flexible linear algebra library that allows users to easily switch between different BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) implementations at runtime without recompiling their code. It provides a level of abstraction to simplify the usage of BLAS functions across various hardware platforms and software libraries.",
