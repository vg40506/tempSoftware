### Software Name: numactl

#### Overview:
numactl is a tool for controlling NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) policy and allocating memory on NUMA systems. It allows users to run processes with specific NUMA memory placement policies, affinity options, and interleave memory allocations.

#### Core Features:
- NUMA hardware control and management
- Assign processes to specific NUMA nodes for improved performance
- Set memory allocation policies
- Monitor and manage NUMA nodes and memory
- Enhance performance by optimizing memory access patterns
