### Software Name: ccs

**Overview:**  
The CCS (Compiler Control System) is a tool used to automate the installation of various compilers. It provides a way to configure and manage multiple compilers on a single system, allowing users to easily switch between different compiler versions and settings. CCS simplifies the process of managing compiler environments for high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

**Core Features:**
- Automates the installation and configuration of compilers.
- Allows users to manage multiple compiler versions and settings on a single system.
- Facilitates easy switching between different compiler environments.
- Streamlines the process of setting up and maintaining compiler configurations for HPC applications.
