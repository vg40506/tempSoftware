# CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test, and package software. It is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler-independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

Covering multiple platforms from UNIX, Linux, macOS to Windows, CMake supports in-place and out-of-place builds and can therefore support multiple builds from a single source tree.

## Core Features

- **Cross-Platform Building**: CMake is compatible across multiple platforms including Unix, Linux, Windows, and macOS.

- **Compilers and Environments**: CMake supports a range of compilers and environments, allowing it to generate makefiles for various build systems and IDEs, such as Make, Ninja, Xcode, and Visual Studio.

- **Custom Builds**: CMake allows you to specify custom build settings and parameters, using the CMake scripting language to create complex build rules.

- **Package Creation**: CMake also offers tools (CPack) for creating installers and source code packages.

- **Testing Support**: CMake includes a testing tool (CTest) that can be used to manage and execute unit tests.
