# PETSc

PETSc, or the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, is an open-source software suite used in the field of scientific computing. Developed by Argonne National Laboratory, PETSc is a collection of data structures and routines for the scalable solutions of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations. It supports parallelism, both distributed and shared memory, making it a powerful tool for large-scale computations.

## Core Features

- **Scalable and Parallel**: PETSc can run on single processors as well as on parallel systems, supporting distributed and shared memory parallelism. 

- **Toolkit for Scientific Computation**: PETSc offers tools to tackle various stages of scientific computation - from matrix construction to solvers for linear and non-linear equations systems.

- **Interoperability**: PETSc is designed to work with other libraries and packages and can utilize other software for certain functionalities, enhancing customization and extensibility.

- **Support for Complex Computations**: PETSc is suitable for complex computations as it supports single, double, and arbitrary precision arithmetic, as well as real and complex numbers.
