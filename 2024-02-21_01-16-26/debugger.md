# Debugger

A debugger is an essential software tool used in the process of testing and debugging programs. It assists programmers by allowing them to monitor the execution (step by step) of a program, spot and fix coding errors, analyze the code at the point where the program crashed, examine variables, track threads and processes, set breakpoints, and change values in memory among other things. 

Debugger tools are usually included in various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), and they come in different types for virtually all programming languages and platforms.

## Core Features 

- **Breakpoints**: Debuggers allow you to set breakpoints in your code. After setting a breakpoint, the program will pause execution at that point, enabling you to analyze the code behavior.

- **Stepping**: This allows you to move your program forward one line or instruction at a time, giving you complete control over the program's execution.

- **Variable Examination**: Debuggers permit you to examine the contents of variables and data structures at any point during the program's execution. 

- **Memory Inspection**: Debuggers offer the feature to inspect the memory space used by the program,  which is extremely useful for understanding how the program is operating and detecting memory-based errors.

- **Call Stack Information**: Debuggers provide information on the execution stack, showing the sequence of function calls that led to the current place in the program.
