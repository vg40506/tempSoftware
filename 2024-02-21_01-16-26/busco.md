# BUSCO 

BUSCO or Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs, is a bioinformatics tool designed to assess genome, transcriptome, and proteome assembly completeness based on evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content from near-universal single-copy orthologs selected from OrthoDB.

BUSCO helps provide quantitative measures for the completeness of genomes and annotations in terms of expected benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs. This tool has a wide application across all forms of life as it offers sets of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) for major lineages, including archea, bacteria, fungi, animals, and more.

## Core Features

- **Assessment of Completeness**: BUSCO performs assessments of genome assembly, gene set, and transcriptome completeness based on universal single-copy orthologs.
- **Ortholog Consistency Validation**: BUSCO analyses individual genomes and gene sets to validate ortholog consistency.
- **Quantitative Measures**: It provides quantitative measures for the levels of completeness by counting the expected number of universal single-copy orthologs.
- **OrthoDB**: Initialization and updates of BUSCO datasets are based on OrthoDB, a comprehensive catalog of orthologous protein-coding genes in vertebrates, arthropods, fungi, plants, and more.
- **User-friendly**: BUSCO is designed to be user-friendly and easy to implement in bioinformatics pipelines.
