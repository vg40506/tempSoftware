# mothur

mothur, an open-source software, is a widely-used bioinformatics toolkit for the processing of amplicon sequence data, particularly for researchers studying microbial ecology and diversity. Patrick Schloss developed the software, intending to make the analysis of microbial ecology data accessible, robust, and reliable. 

mothur incorporates a series of algorithms which can construct phylogenetic trees and classify sequences, amongst other tasks, thereby allowing for processing, analysis, and exploration of microbial community amplicon sequence data.

## Core Features

- **Sequence Quality Control**: mothur provides a full suite of tools to perform quality assurance and control on the sequence data. 

- **Data Analysis**: It integrates disparate algorithms for performing clustering, classification, and ordination operations on the data.

- **Pipeline Integration**: mothur can integrate various bioinformatics tools into a cohesive analysis pipeline.

- **High Throughput Sequencing Data**: Efficiently manages and analyzes high-throughput sequencing data related to microbial species.

- **Community Support**: Being an open-source project, mothur has a vast and active community base providing solutions and resources to new users.
