# Quantum

Quantum refers to Quantum Computing, which is a branch of computing focused on the development of computer-based technologies centered on the principles of quantum theory, explaining the behavior of energy and material on quantum (atomic and subatomic) levels.

There are numerous Quantum Computing platforms, tools, libraries, and simulators available that aid in developing applications, implementing algorithms, and conducting simulations for quantum computation.

One popular example is Quantum Development Kit by Microsoft, which includes Q#, a programming language for expressing quantum algorithms.

## Core Features

- **Superposition Principle**: Quantum computing leverages the properties of quantum superposition, where quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
- **Entanglement Property**: Quantum computing also takes advantage of entanglement, a phenomenon that occurs when particles become interconnected, and the state of one particle can directly influence the state of other particles no matter the distance.
- **Parallelism**: The properties of superposition and entanglement in quantum computing allow for significant computational parallelism.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Quantum computers can execute complex quantum algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm for factoring and Grover’s algorithm for unsorted database searching.
