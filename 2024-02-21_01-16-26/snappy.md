# Snappy

Snappy, a part of Google's open source community, is a compression/decompression library. Designed to be fast and efficient, snappy does not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. 

As a result, Snappy can help you compress and decompress data rapidly and also promises stability with your library version. The computational costs for using Snappy are pretty minimalist, making it an excellent choice if you're looking for quick and easy compression solutions.

## Core Features
- **High Speed Performance:** Snappy puts a premium on speed. Its primary purpose is to deliver data compression and decompression at a fast rate. 

- **Decent Compression Rate:** While snappy does not aim for maximum compression, it does provide a reasonable compression rate, making it a good choice for several types of workloads.
   
- **Stable:** Snappy provides a stable ABI that can be utilized across a variety of versions.
