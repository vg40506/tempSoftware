## ANSYS

**Overview:**  
ANSYS is a simulation software suite used to solve complex engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and other advanced simulation techniques. It is widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and electronics for design and optimization.

**Core Features:**  
1. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural analysis, heat transfer, and modal analysis.
2. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for fluid flow and heat transfer simulations.
3. Electromagnetics simulation for antenna design and electromagnetic compatibility.
4. Multiphysics simulation for coupled physics problems.
5. Optimization tools for design exploration and parameter optimization.
6. Customization through scripting and programming interfaces.
