## ATK

**Overview:**  
Atomistic Toolkit (ATK) is a software package for electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and other quantum mechanical methods. It is used for modeling and simulating materials at the atomic level in the fields of computational chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics.

**Core Features:**  
1. Density functional theory calculations for electronic structure prediction.
2. Quantum mechanical simulations for atoms, molecules, and solids.
3. Configuration interaction and GW methods for accurate results.
4. Tight-binding and classical force field models for molecular dynamics.
5. Visualization tools for analyzing atomic structures and properties.
6. Interface with other software packages for broader applications.
