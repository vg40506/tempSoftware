## AOCL

**Overview:**  
The Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL (AOCL) is a software development kit that enables developers to create applications that harness the power of Intel FPGAs using the OpenCL programming framework. It allows for high-performance computing and acceleration of workloads through FPGA-based parallel processing.

**Core Features:**  
1. Integration of OpenCL framework with Intel FPGAs for acceleration.
2. Support for parallel programming and heterogeneous computing.
3. Optimization tools for efficient FPGA resource utilization.
4. Interface for developing custom FPGA-accelerated kernels.
5. Performance profiling and debugging capabilities.
6. Compatibility with Intel FPGA development boards and tools.
