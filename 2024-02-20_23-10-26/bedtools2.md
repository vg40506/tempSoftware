**Overview:**
BEDTools is a suite of command-line tools for manipulating genomic data files in BED (Browser Extensible Data) format. These tools allow users to perform a wide range of operations on genomic intervals, such as intersection, merging, subtracting, and creating new annotations based on overlap of genomic features.

**Core features:**
1. Genomic interval operations.
2. Intersection and overlap analysis.
3. Merging and splitting genomic regions.
4. Feature annotation and filtering.
5. Handling BED and other common genomics formats.
