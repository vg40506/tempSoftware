bedtools2
**Overview:**
BEDTools2 is a software suite for the analysis of genomic data. It offers a set of tools for manipulating BED (Browser Extensible Data) files, which are used to represent genomic region data. BEDTools2 provides essential functionalities for common genomics tasks such as intersecting, merging, comparing, and converting genomic intervals.

**Core Features:**
- Intersecting genomic intervals from multiple BED files
- Merging overlapping intervals within a BED file
- Finding the complement or differences between sets of intervals
- Calculating coverage and overlaps of genomic regions
- Converting between various genomic file formats
- Batch processing and scripting capabilities for automation
