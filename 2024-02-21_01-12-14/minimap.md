## Software Name: Minimap

Minimap is a fast and lightweight sequence mapping tool that can efficiently align DNA or RNA sequences to a reference genome or transcriptome. It is designed for rapid mapping of long reads, such as those produced by third-generation sequencing technologies like PacBio or Oxford Nanopore.

### Core Features:
- Minimization of reference genomes
- Fast and memory-efficient alignment of long reads
- Mapping of both DNA and RNA sequences
- Support for various sequencing technologies
- Output in standard alignment formats
