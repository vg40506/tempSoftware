## Software Name: hwloc

hwloc (Hardware Locality) is a software library for exploring and manipulating the topology of modern computing architectures. It provides a unified interface to discover the hierarchical structure of CPUs, memory, caches, and other hardware components, enabling users to optimize their software for better performance on complex hardware configurations.

### Core Features:
- Hierarchical representation of hardware components
- CPU binding and affinity control
- Memory affinity management
- I/O device locality information
- NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) awareness
- GPU and accelerator support
