**Software Name:** Valgrind

**Overview:**
Valgrind is a powerful instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools that can detect memory leaks, thread errors, and other run-time issues in C, C++, and other programming languages. It provides a suite of tools, including Memcheck, Helgrind, and Massif, to help developers identify memory-related errors and optimize their code. Valgrind aids in improving program reliability, performance, and debugging efficiency through comprehensive run-time analysis.

**Core Features:**
- Memory error detection (leaks, invalid reads/writes)
- Thread error detection and synchronization issues
- Cache and branch prediction profiling
- Memory allocation tracking and profiling
- Support for custom user-defined tools
- Heap and stack memory usage analysis
- Dynamic instrumentation for binary analysis
