**Software Name:** GObject (Glib Object System)

**Overview:**
GObject, part of the GLib library, is an object-oriented framework in the C programming language that provides support for object-oriented programming paradigms. It is commonly used in the development of GTK applications and other software projects that require object-oriented design in C. GObject simplifies the creation and management of objects, inheritance, interfaces, signals, and properties in C-based projects.

**Core Features:**
- Object-oriented programming support in C
- Class and object creation with inheritance
- Interface definition and implementation
- Signals and event handling mechanism
- Property system for object attributes
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Integration with GLib and GTK libraries
