## GATK4 (Genome Analysis Toolkit 4)

The Genome Analysis Toolkit 4 (GATK4) is a software package developed by the Broad Institute to analyze high-throughput sequencing data. It provides a wide array of tools with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping. GATK4 includes both small variant discovery tools and large structural variant discovery tools.

### Core Features 

1. **Variant Discovery**: GATK4 has several built-in variant discovery algorithms that can find both common and rare variants in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.

2. **Genotyping**: GATK4 incorporates a powerful genotyping engine that allows for the detection of indels and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in NGS data.

3. **Annotation**: GATK4 can annotate variant calls with relevant data, providing important contextual information for further analysis.

4. **Validity and Quality Checking**: GATK4 includes features for checking the quality of variant calls and can filter out false positive calls based on various statistical thresholds.
