## BWA-kit

BWA-kit is a package that includes Burrow-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and several related tools. BWA is a software package used for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform to compress the genome, allowing it to handle large data sets effectively. This kit can perform various tasks including read mapping, overlapping pairs merging, and sequence alignment, making it an invaluable tool for bioinformatics researchers.

### Core Features 

1. **Speed**: BWA-kit enables fast and accurate alignment of short reads to reference sequences using Burrows-Wheeler Transform and Ferragina-Manzini (FM-index).
   
2. **Alignment**: BWA performs end-to-end alignment and local alignment of sequencing reads.

3. **Efficiency**: BWA allows for mapping of low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome like the human genome.

4. **Pair-end Mapping**: BWA supports efficient pair-end mapping, allowing it to map the sequence from both ends.

5. **Support**: BWA-kit supports several formats including SAM/BAM, FASTA/FASTQ, and more, providing flexibility in the type of files it can work with.
