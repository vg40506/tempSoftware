## REDItools2

REDItools2 is a suite of Python scripts for studying RNA editing from next-generation sequencing data (NGS). RNA editing is a post-transcriptional alteration of RNA molecules including substitutions, insertions, deletions which can affect gene expression and function. REDItools are specifically designed for High-Throughput Sequencing data and contain both simple (REDItools simple) and advanced (REDItools denovo, REDItools known, and REDItools RNA-RNA) tools. 

### Core Features 

1. **RNA Editing Detection**: REDItools2 can identify RNA editing events from NGS data efficiently.

2. **High-throughput Analysis**: It can handle large NGS data sets, making it suitable for exploring RNA editing in various contexts.

3. **Variety of Tools**: Consists of simple as well as advanced tools for different levels of RNA editing analysis, including REDItools known, REDItools denovo, and REDItools RNA-RNA.

4. **Compatibility**: REDItools2 is compatible with BAM (Binary Alignment Map) and SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) input files.
