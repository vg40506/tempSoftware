## libgpg-error

libgpg-error is a small library that defines common error values for all GnuPG components. GnuPG stands for GNU Privacy Guard and is a free, complete, and free replacement for Symantec's PGP cryptographic software suite. This library allows GnuPG components to use a common set of error codes and error handling routines. Besides GnuPG, it's being utilized in various other projects.

### Core Features 

1. **Error Codes Management**: libgpg-error provides a set of error codes and corresponding descriptive texts. It helps standardize error handling across GnuPG components.

2. **Localization Support**: It includes translations for the error codes in several languages.

3. **Portability**: This library provides portability wrappers for some commonly used functions absent in older systems.

4. **Thread-Safe**: libgpg-error is designed to be thread-safe and can be used in multithreaded applications.
