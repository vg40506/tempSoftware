## libSM

libSM, also known as libSM.so, is a Session Management library found in Unix-like operating systems. This library allows developers to write applications that can save and restore their state between sessions. For example, when a user logs out of their system, applications using libSM can save their current activity and display the same status when the user logs back in.

### Core Features 

1. **Session Management**: libSM offers developers the ability to save the state of an application between sessions.

2. **Interoperability**: libSM is compatible with a variety of systems, making it a versatile tool for developers.

3. **Standards Compliance**: The library conforms to the X11 Inter-Client Exchange (ICE) and Session Management (SM) protocols, making it a standard tool in Unix-like OS.

4. **Flexibility**: It helps developers create applications with persistent states, improving the user experience.
