## Git

Git is a distributed version control system, primarily used to track changes in source code during software development. Originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux Kernel, it is now used by millions of projects around the globe. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes and keeps a complete record of all changes to a project's codebase.

### Core Features 

1. **Distributed Version Control System**: Git provides each developer a local copy of the entire project, enabling faster operations since activities like commits, diff, log, etc. are run locally.

2. **Branching and Merging**: Git supports rapid branching and merging and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. A key feature of Git is its branching model, which allows developers to create new branches for feature development, bug fixes, or experimentation without disturbing the main codebase.

3. **Staging Area**: Git provides a staging area or 'index', where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

4. **Small and Fast**: Git is designed to be fast and performant. Compared to other version control systems, Git is minimal and speed-optimized.

5. **Data Protection**: Git uses the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function, ensuring data integrity and protecting the code against accidental and malicious change.
