## Stacks

Stacks is a software suite developed for genomics research and processing large volumes of data from high-throughput sequencing. It primarily aims to examine the population genetics of an organism and to find and genotype them. It focuses on analyzing raw reads, as well as data aligned to a reference genome, allowing researchers to study changes in the genome structure of different populations across time and space.

### Core Features 

1. **Genotype Calling**: Stacks determines and annotates the genotypes present in a set of aligned or raw sequences.
   
2. **Population Genomics Analysis**: The software suite can be used to perform analyses on the genomics data of different populations of an organism.

3. **De Novo Map Construction**: Stacks is capable of de novo map construction, i.e., building a genome map without the use of a reference genome.

4. **Diverse Data Support**: It can work with various types of data, including short-read sequences like RAD-seq.

5. **Genomic Distance Computation**: Stacks can calculate the genomic distances between different samples and valuate genetic differences between populations.
