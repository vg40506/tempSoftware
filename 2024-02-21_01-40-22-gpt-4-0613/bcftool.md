# BCFtools

## Overview
BCFtools is a powerful set of utilities used for manipulating variant calls in the Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. Both formats are commonly used for storing high-throughput sequencing data and associated annotations. BCFtools has commands for variant calling, manipulating VCFs and BCFS, understanding and reporting statistics, etc. 

The tool, developed by the Genome Research Limited, is mainly used in the field of genomics and bioinformatics. BCFtools is commonly known for its integrity in handling of the massive data in variant calling tasks.

## Core Features
1. Variant calling: BCFtools facilitates calling and genotyping of variants.
2. VCF/BCF manipulation: The toolset allows easy manipulation and conversion of VCFs and BCFs.
3. Data integrity: It handles large-scale bioinformatics data with precision and accuracy.
4. Genomic statistics: It provides various statistics on genomic data.
5. Advanced filtering: BCFtools enables advanced variant filtering.
