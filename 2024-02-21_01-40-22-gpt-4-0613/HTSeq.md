# HTSeq

## Overview
HTSeq is a Python library specifically designed to work with high-throughput sequencing data. Developed by Simon Anders at EMBL, HTSeq provides data structures for short read alignments and features, along with powerful scripts to perform common tasks such as gene quantification and SNP calling.

HTSeq supports both SAM/BAM and GFF/GTF file formats, and integrates with popular Python scientific computing packages like NumPy and matplotlib. While it is mainly targeted towards bioinformaticians, HTSeq can be a powerful tool for any researchers dealing with high-throughput sequencing data.

## Core Features
1. Comprehensive Framework for High-throughput Sequencing data: HTSeq provides a full set of features specifically to handle the complex needs of high-throughput sequencing data.
2. Multiple Script Utilities: Includes pre-built scripts to handle common bioinformatics tasks, which can also serve as examples for building custom analysis pipelines.
3. Data structures: It provides unique data structures that are tailored towards the analysis of sequencing data.
4. Integration: HTSeq integrates well with Python's scientific computing stack, including NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib etc.
