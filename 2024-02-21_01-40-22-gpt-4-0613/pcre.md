# PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

## Overview
PCRE is a library written in C that implements regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5, with just a few differences. The library provides functions for matching patterns, searching and replacing, and splitting text based on patterns. PCRE makes it easy for applications to include robust and flexible pattern matching without having to build the capability from scratch.

The PCRE library is free, even for building proprietary software. It has been widely adopted, and it is used in many notable open source projects like Apache, PHP, and R language, among others.

## Core Features
1. Perl-compatible regular expressions: PCRE provides a rich pattern matching syntax that is nearly identical to Perl 5.
2. UTF-8 and Unicode support: PCRE can compile and run regular expressions on UTF-8 encoded strings, or on sixteen-bit character strings.
3. Multi-pattern search: Allows the user to search a subject string for a number of different patterns at once.
4. Highly flexible: Works with a wide variety of character sets and is used in various programming and scripting languages.
5. Extensive documentation: The library comes with complete documentation describing the PCRE API and regex syntax in detail.
