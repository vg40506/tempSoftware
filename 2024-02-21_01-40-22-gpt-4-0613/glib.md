# GLib

## Overview
GLib is a general-purpose utility library, which was originally part of the GTK+ project, but can be used independently outside of a graphical environment. It provides numerous core data structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, strings, and many more. 

Moreover, it supports functionalities like main event loop, handling of dynamic loading of modules, and object system that enhances the C programming language. It enables sophisticated modern programming techniques such as exception handling, type checking, signals & slots, and more in C language.

## Core Features
1. Data types: Offers numerous fundamental data types for C like strings, byte arrays, and more.
2. Data structures: Supports arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, and more.
3. Main event loop: Allows for asynchronous events and timeouts.
4. Object system: Enhances the C programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
5. Utilities: Supports handling of dynamic loading of modules, manipulation of date and time, command line parsing, etc.
