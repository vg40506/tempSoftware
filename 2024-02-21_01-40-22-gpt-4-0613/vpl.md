# Intel oneAPI Video Processing Library (VPL)

## Overview
Intel oneAPI Video Processing Library (VPL) is a powerful software library designed for developers to create high-performance video applications. It offers a framework for encoding, decoding, and processing video data at high speeds. The primary objective of Intel VPL is to provide the developers with an efficient and versatile platform to develop, optimize and scale video processing software.

VPL is part of Intel's oneAPI, a unified programming model to simplify development across multiple processing units. It's designed to work across multiple types of Intel hardware such as GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs. VPL provides a media-oriented API for video applications and takes advantage of Intel's high-performing video hardware capabilities.

## Core Features
1. Multi-format support: Intel VPL supports a wide range of video coding formats, including AVC, AV1, HEVC, MPEG-2, VP9, and more.
2. High-performance: It takes full advantage of Intel's hardware capabilities to provide high-performance video processing.
3. Scalable: The library can be used on a single machine or across a distributed network for larger workloads.
4. Hardware acceleration: VPL is designed to take advantage of hardware accelerators present in Intel processors for efficient video processing.
5. Media API: Provides a C-based API for video applications.
