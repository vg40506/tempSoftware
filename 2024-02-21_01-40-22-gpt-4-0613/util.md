# util

## Overview
`util` is a generic term used across numerous software libraries, frameworks, and languages referring to miscellaneous "utility" functions that don't necessarily belong to a specific module or package. These utility functions often provide convenience methods that are frequently used within the given programming ecosystem.

While it's hard to narrow down specifics without a particular context, `util` packages exist in many popular programming languages such as Node.js, Java, Python, etc., where they can provide various functionalities like formatting strings, handling dates, mathematical functions, debug utilities, and more depending on the language at hand.

## Core Features (Generic)
1. Debugging: These utility functions can provide methods to debug code more efficiently.
2. Formatting: `util` often contains functions for formatting strings, numbers and dates.
3. Math operations: Might contain different functions for mathematical operations.
4. Comparison: Can provide functions for comparing different data types.
5. Operating system specifics: Might offer functions to interact with or gather data about the underlying operating system.

## Web Resources
Given the generic nature of `util`, there's no definitive source to provide. It would depend on the specific programming language or framework you're looking at.

## Documentation and Tutorials
Once again, documentation and tutorials would relate to the programming language or framework you're interested in. Node.js's `util` package, for example, is documented on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html). Other languages or frameworks would have their own relevant documentation.
