# SAMBLASTER

## Overview
SAMBLASTER is a high-performance bioinformatics tool used to mark duplicates and output split read and/or discordant read pair SAM flags for identifying structural variant breakpoints in DNA sequencing data. It takes input files in the Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format and processes them to generate output.

SAMBLASTER is commonly used in genomics research, specialty areas of bioinformatics, and sequencing projects, enabling users to more accurately and efficiently analyze sequencing data. 

## Core Features
1. Duplication marking: SAMBLASTER identifies and marks duplicates in SAM files.
2. Structural variant identification: It aids in identifying structural variant breakpoints in DNA sequencing data.
3. High performance: SAMBLASTER is known for its speed and performance in handling large files.
4. Split read/discordant read pair flagging: The tool outputs split read and/or discordant read pair SAM flags.
5. Flexible and powerful: It provides many options for the display of output, making it a flexible tool for data analysis.
