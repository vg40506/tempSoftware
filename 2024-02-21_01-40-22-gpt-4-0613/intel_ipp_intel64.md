# Intel Integrated Performance Primitives

## Overview
Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP) is an extensive library of multi-threaded software functions for digital media, data processing applications, and more. The primary objective of IPP is to provide the developers with highly optimized, production-ready, and lower-level building components for developing high-performance software applications.

Intel IPP offers more than 4000 functions within the fields of image processing, signal processing, data compression, encryption, speech recognition, computer vision, linear algebra, and more. The primitives within the Intel IPP can be used industry-wide and not just for media applications.

## Core Features
1. The highly optimized library from Intel provides maximum performance on Intel architecture.
2. It includes functionalities for digital media, including audio, video, and images.
3. It provides tools to help in data compressions and encryption.
4. It offers functionalities within the field of computer vision and advanced matrix and vector mathematics.
5. It is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, and supports OS-specific features.
6. It also offers backward compatibility to ensure seamless integration with older architectures.
