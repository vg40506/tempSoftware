# GNU Diffutils

## Overview
GNU Diffutils is a package of several programs related to finding differences between files. Computer users often find themselves in situations where they want to find differences between files, and this is exactly what diffutils helps with.

The main programs included in the Diffutils package are 'diff', 'diff3', 'cmp' and 'sdiff'. 'diff' shows the differences line by line and also in various other formats. 'diff3' shows differences among three files. 'cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where two files differ, and 'sdiff' merges two files interactively.

These tools are particularly useful for programmers who are managing versions of their projects/files, or to anyone who needs to compare different versions of text files.

## Core Features
1. File comparison: Facilitates the process of finding differences between multiple files.
2. Line by line differences: Shows differences between files on a line-by-line basis.
3. Interaction merging: sdiff allows for merging two files interactively.
4. Various output formats: Provides multiple output formats that can capture the differences in various ways.
5. Useful in various scenarios: Use-cases include tracking changes in source code and text files.
