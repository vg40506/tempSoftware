HMMER is an open source bioinformatics software suite for protein sequence similarity searches. It uses a set of profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) to detect homologous protein or nucleotide sequences. HMMER provides a sophisticated query language, probabilistic inference, a variety of output formats, and tools for aligning sequences and manipulating alignments.

## Core Features

- **Profile HMMs** : Create profiles from multiple sequence alignments that represent the consensus of known protein families.
- **Sequence Statistical Analysis** : Use profile HMM technology for advanced statistical analysis of protein sequences.
- **Scalability and Speed** : Leveraged by many public bioinformatics services because it scales linearly with database size and therefore runs quickly.
- **Multi-platform Support** : Can run on Unix-based systems, Macintosh, and Windows operating systems.
- **Sequence Database Searching** : Uses sequence database searching to detect remote members of protein families.
