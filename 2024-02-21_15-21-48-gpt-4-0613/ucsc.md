# UCSC Genome Browser

The UCSC Genome Browser is a web-based application developed by the Genome Bioinformatics Group of the University of California, Santa Cruz. This tool provides the reference sequences and working draft assemblies for a large collection of genomes, along with alignment, annotation, and other valuable data. An integrated suite of tools aids users to view, analyze, and download information about the genomes.

## Core Features

- **Cross-Species Comparison**: Helps to compare genes and genomes across different species.
- **Extensive Annotation**: Offers information about genes, gene prediction, expression, regulation, variation, and disease association.
- **User-Defined Custom Tracks**: Allows users to upload their own data to be displayed on the browser.
- **Data Download Capability**: Provides full or partial genomic sequences and annotations in multiple formats.
- **BLAT Search Tool**: Quickly aligns sequences to the genome.
