# Ghostscript

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF. It's a suite of software that provides an interpreting platform for Adobe systems' PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF), capable of rendering them and converting these files into a variety of other formats. Developed by Artifex Software Inc, Ghostscript functions as a set of C procedures that implements graphics and filtering.

## Core Features

- **Ease of Conversion**: Ghostscript can read PostScript and PDF files, and output them as PDF, image files, or simply display them on the screen.
- **Device Color Profiles**: It could allow devices like monitors, printers, and scanners to handle colors in a way that can be reproduced across different devices.
- **High Quality Rendering**: Provides high-quality anti-aliased rendering of graphics and text.
- **Interop Capability**: In combination with different other open source programs, Ghostscript can adapt to multiple functions including complete conversion between different document types.
- **Support for Various Programming Languages**: Libraries can be used to implement PostScript and pdf language capabilities in programs written in multiple programming languages.
