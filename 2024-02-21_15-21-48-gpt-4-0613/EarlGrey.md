# EarlGrey

EarlGrey is an open source functional UI testing framework for iOS developed by Google that allows developers to write clear, concise tests. It synchronizes with the UI, network requests, and various queues, although still allowing manual synchronization of test code when needed.

## Core Features

- **Synchronization Features** EarlGrey automatically synchronizes with the UI, network requests, and various queues, but still allows you to manually implement customized timings, if needed.
- **White-Box Test Support** It is built to support white-box testing, giving developers full access to the apps' classes and variables.
- **Intuitive Matchers** EarlGrey includes a powerful built-in synchronizing mechanism, which allows it to have stable tests.
- **Integrated Components** EarlGrey works directly with the XCTest framework and integrates with Xcodeâ€™s Test Navigator, so you can run tests, and see results and errors directly within Xcode.
- **Rich Test Reports** EarlGrey is capable to generate detailed and comprehensive test reports which can be used for troubleshooting.
