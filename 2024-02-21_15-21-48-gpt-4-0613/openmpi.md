# OpenMPI

OpenMPI is an open-source, portable, and flexible implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard that allows developers to write and run parallel applications on a variety of high-performance computing platforms. It supports a range of parallel computing environments, including single multi-core systems, network clusters of machines, and many-core and hardware-accelerated systems.

## Core Features

- **Wide Support**: Supports a wide variety of high-performance interconnects, processors, and configurations.
- **Point-to-Point Communication**: Supports MPI send and receive functionality, allowing efficient processor-to-processor communication.
- **Collective Communications**: Offers pre-designed MPI operations that can be performed on all processes at once.
- **MPI Derived Datatypes**: Allows complex data structures to be sent and received in a single operation.
- **Process Management (MPI 2.0):** API for spawning additional MPI processes and establishing communication between them.
