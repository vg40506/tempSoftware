# XF86VidModeProto

XF86VidModeProto is the open-source header file for the XFree86-VidMode X server extension. It is not a standalone software but rather a constituent part of the X Window System that provides support for changing video modes of a monitor and to the Gamma correction. The package is an integral part of XFree86, a freely redistributable open-source implementation of the X Window System that works on Unix-like operating systems.

## Core Features

- **Video Mode Changing**: It allows software programs to interact with the X server to change video modes.
- **Gamma Correction Interface**: Provides an API to adjust the gamma correction of a monitor.
- **Software Development Support**: Acts as the header for developing software that uses the XFree86-VidMode Extension.
