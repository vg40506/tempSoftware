# librsvg

librsvg is an open-source software library for rendering SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images to Cairo surfaces. The library is written in C and serves as one of the primary SVG rendering libraries, highly valued for its efficiency and speed. It provides developers with a means of integrating SVG image support into their applications, and it is notably used within software such as GNOME desktop environments, Image viewer Eye of GNOME and PDF viewer Evince.

## Core Features

- **SVG Rendering Capabilities**: It opens and renders SVG files, a popular vector graphics format.
- **Cairo Surface Utilization**: It translates SVG files into Cairo surfaces, enabling easy integration with any Cairo-based graphics stack.
- **High-Level Language Bindings**: libRSVG can be used in languages like Rust and Python.
- **Image Manipulation**: Supports transformations, pattern tiling, and alpha blending.
- **High Efficiency**: Provides a compact, high-speed solution for rendering SVG images.
