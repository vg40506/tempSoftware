## PCangsd

**PCangsd** is a software tool that performs principal component analysis (PCA) on genotype likelihood data generated with the **ANGSD** (Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data) software. It is specifically designed for population genetics studies to visualize and analyze genetic variation among individuals or populations.

### Core Features:
- Utilizes genotype likelihoods produced by ANGSD for PCA analysis.
- Allows users to investigate population structure and genetic relationships based on genomic data.
- Supports visualization of PCA results through scatter plots and other graphical representations.
- Enables researchers to identify patterns of genetic differentiation and clustering within populations.
