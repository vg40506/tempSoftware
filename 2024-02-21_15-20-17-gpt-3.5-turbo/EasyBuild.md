## EasyBuild

EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. It is designed to make building software simple and reproducible, aiming to automate the process as much as possible to save time and effort.

### Core Features:
- EasyBuild uses easyconfig files to define how software packages should be built and installed.
- It can handle the installation of dependencies and different versions of software packages.
- Supports a wide range of compilers, libraries, and tools commonly used in HPC environments.
- Integrates with module systems like Lmod and Environment Modules to manage software installations.
