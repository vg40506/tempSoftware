## TPMcalculator

**TPMcalculator** is a software tool designed for calculating gene expression levels in RNA-Seq data using the Transcripts Per Million (TPM) normalization method. It allows researchers to quantify gene expression and compare expression levels across samples accurately.

### Core Features:
- Utilizes RNA-Seq read counts to determine gene expression levels normalized by transcript length and sequencing depth.
- Supports the TPM normalization method for accurate and comparable gene expression quantification.
- Provides statistics and visualizations to aid in the analysis and interpretation of gene expression data.
- Enables researchers to generate TPM values for downstream differential expression analysis.
