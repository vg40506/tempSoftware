**libXtst** is a X11 library that provides an X Window System client interface to the XTEST extension. The XTEST extension enables users to generate and control input events, such as mouse movements and keystrokes, programmatically on X server. It is commonly used in testing frameworks and automation tools.

### Core Features:
- Allows X Window System clients to simulate user input events like mouse clicks, key presses, and motion.
- Provides functions to query input device information and status on the X server.
- Supports testing and automation of X Window System applications by simulating user interactions.
- Enables integration with testing frameworks for GUI testing and automation.
