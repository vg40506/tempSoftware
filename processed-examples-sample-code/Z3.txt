Use Case: The Z3 theorem prover is a powerful tool for verifying and reasoning about mathematical formulas and software. It is widely used in various domains such as software and hardware verification, constraint solving, and formal methods.

Code details and examples:
Z3 supports various input formats such as SMT-LIB, Z3 input language, and its own Python API. Here is an example of using Z3 in Python to solve a simple set of constraints:

```python
from z3 import *

# Create Z3 integer variables
x = Int('x')
y = Int('y')

# Create Z3 solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Add constraints
solver.add(x > 0)
solver.add(y > 0)
solver.add(x + y == 10)

# Check if constraints are satisfiable
if solver.check() == sat:
    m = solver.model()
    print("Solution:")
    print("x =", m[x])
    print("y =", m[y])
else:
    print("Constraints are unsat")
```

To run the above code, you need to have Z3 installed in your Python environment. You can run the script using a Python interpreter.

Command to run the Python script:
```
python script.py
```

This will output the solution to the set of constraints specified in the code.
