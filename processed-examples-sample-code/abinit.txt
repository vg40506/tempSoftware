Use Case: abinit is an open-source software for electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory.

Code details and examples:
ABINIT requires an input file in its own format called "input file". Below is an example of an input file for a simple calculation:

```plaintext
# Example input file for ABINIT
ndtset 1          ! Number of datasets
ecut 10           ! Plane-wave cutoff energy in Hartree
ntypat 1          ! Number of types of atoms
znucl 6           ! Nuclear charge of atom type 1 (Carbon)
natom 1           ! Number of atoms in the unit cell
typat 1           ! Atom type for each atom
xred              ! Fractional coordinates of atoms
0.0 0.0 0.0
```

To run ABINIT with the input file, you can use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
abinit < input_file > output_file
```

This command runs ABINIT using the provided input file and directs the output to "output_file".
Remember to replace "input_file" with the actual name of your input file.

Note: This is a basic example, and ABINIT supports a wide range of input options for more advanced calculations. Refer to the ABINIT documentation for detailed information on input file format and available options.
