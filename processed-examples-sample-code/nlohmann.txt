I am not familiar with a software package called "nlohmann." However, nlohmann is the last name of the creator of a popular C++ JSON library called "nlohmann/json". If this is what you are referring to, I can provide examples using this library for JSON parsing.

Use Case: JSON Parsing using nlohmann/json
Code details and examples:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "json.hpp"

using json = nlohmann::json;

int main() {
    // Sample JSON input
    json j = {
        {"key1", "value1"},
        {"key2", 42},
        {"key3", true}
    };

    // Accessing values in JSON object
    std::cout << "Value of key1: " << j["key1"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value of key2: " << j["key2"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value of key3: " << j["key3"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Compile the above code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and link it with the nlohmann/json library. Run the compiled executable to see the output.
