Use Case: Audio compression and encoding with libopus

Code details and examples:
Libopus is a library that implements the Opus audio codec, which is designed for interactive speech and audio transmission over the internet. It supports variable bitrate (VBR), constant bitrate (CBR), and average bitrate (ABR) encoding modes.

To use libopus, you can use the opusenc utility to encode audio files to the Opus format. Here is an example of how to encode a WAV file to Opus format:

1. Sample input file (input.wav):
This is a sample WAV audio file that you want to encode to Opus format.

2. Command to encode WAV to Opus:
```
opusenc input.wav output.opus
```

This command will encode the input.wav file to Opus format and save it as output.opus.

3. Advanced options:
You can specify additional options when using opusenc, such as specifying the bitrate or setting the complexity level. For example:
```
opusenc --bitrate 128 input.wav output.opus
```

This command will encode the input.wav file to Opus format with a bitrate of 128 kbps.

Please note that you may need to install libopus and opus-tools to use the opusenc utility.
