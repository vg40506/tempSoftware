Use Case: Automake is a tool for automatically generating makefiles.
Code details and examples:
Automake requires a configuration file named Makefile.am to be present in the project directory. Below is an example Makefile.am file:

```Makefile
bin_PROGRAMS = my_program
my_program_SOURCES = main.c func.c
```

To generate the Makefile from Makefile.am, you can run the following command:

```bash
automake --add-missing
```

This will generate a Makefile in the project directory based on the specifications given in Makefile.am. 

To complete the setup and generate the configure script, you can run:

```bash
autoconf
```

This will generate the configure script which can be used to configure the project for compilation.
