It seems you are referring to the open-source operating system University of Illinois/NCSA (OSU) micro-benchmark suite. Below are some examples with sample input files, formats required, any specifications, and code snippets:

Use Case: Benchmarking CPU performance
Code details and examples:
- Sample Input File: No specific input files required
- Format: N/A
- Specifications: The OSU Micro-Benchmarks provide a set of tests for measuring the performance of MPI libraries on clusters.
- Code Snippet:
  ```bash
  mpirun -n 4 osu_bw
  ```

Use Case: Testing MPI Bandwidth
Code details and examples:
- Sample Input File: No specific input files required
- Format: N/A
- Specifications: This benchmark measures the end-to-end bandwidth of message passing operations between MPI processes.
- Code Snippet:
  ```bash
  mpirun -n 4 osu_bibw
  ```

Use Case: Latency testing
Code details and examples:
- Sample Input File: No specific input files required
- Format: N/A
- Specifications: This benchmark measures the latency of point-to-point message passing operations between MPI processes.
- Code Snippet:
  ```bash
  mpirun -n 4 osu_latency
  ```

Please note that the above examples assume you have the OSU Micro-Benchmarks suite installed on your system. The exact commands may vary based on your setup.
