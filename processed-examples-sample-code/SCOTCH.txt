Use Case: SCOTCH is a software package for graph partitioning, static mapping, and sparse matrix ordering.
Code details and examples:
1. Graph partitioning:
Sample input file (graph.txt):
```
8 10
0 1 2
0 2 1
1 2 3
1 3 1
2 3 1
2 4 2
3 4 1
3 5 2
4 6 2
5 6 1
```

Command to run SCOTCH graph partitioning:
```
gmk_m2 8 10 graph.txt graph.m2
gpmetis graph.m2 2
```
This will partition the graph into 2 parts.

2. Sparse matrix ordering:
Sample input file (matrix.txt):
```
5 5
1 1 1
1 2 1
2 2 1
3 3 1
4 4 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 5 1
```

Command to run SCOTCH sparse matrix ordering:
```
scotch_amk_p spaff matrix.txt matrix
```
This will perform sparse matrix ordering on the input matrix.

3. Static mapping:
SCOTCH can also be used for static mapping of tasks onto processors.

Please note that the input file formats may vary depending on the specific use case within SCOTCH.
