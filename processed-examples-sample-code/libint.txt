Use Case: Matrix element computations in quantum chemistry calculations.
Code details and examples:
Libint provides a library for efficient computation of molecular integrals for quantum chemistry calculations. It is commonly used in electronic structure calculations.

Example of using libint to calculate molecular integrals:
```c
#include <libint2/eri.h>
#include <libint2/engine.h>

using namespace libint2;

int main() {
    const char* molecule = "H 0 0 0\nH 0 0 0.74";
    const auto bf = Operator::coulomb; // compute two electron repulsion integrals
    const auto engine = Engine(bf, max_nprim(bf), max_l(bf), 0);
    const auto shells = engine.target(basis, basis);

    const auto integrals = engine.compute(shells);
    
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run the code:
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o my_program my_program.cpp -l libint2
./my_program
```

Please note that the input file containing the molecular geometry and basis set must be provided in a specific format as expected by the Libint functionality.
