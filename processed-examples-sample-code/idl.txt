I'm assuming you are referring to IDL (Interactive Data Language) by Harris Geospatial Solutions. 

Use Case: Visualization and analysis of scientific data in astronomy, geosciences, and other fields.
Code details and examples:
```idl
; Sample input file: data.txt
; Format: x y
; Comments: # symbol at the beginning of a line
1 10
2 20
3 30

; Code snippet to read data and plot a simple graph
data = read_ascii('data.txt', /silent)
plot, data[*, 0], data[*, 1], /xsty
```

Use Case: Image processing and analysis.
Code details and examples:
```idl
; Sample input file: image.fits
; Format: FITS image file
; Note: FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is a standard format in astronomy
image = mrdfits('image.fits', 0)
histogram, image, min=min_value, max=max_value, binsize=10
```

Use Case: Time series analysis.
Code details and examples:
```idl
; Sample input file: timeseries.dat
; Format: time value
; Comments: # symbol at the beginning of a line
time_series = read_ascii('timeseries.dat', /silent)
result = timeseries_analysis(time_series)
print, result
```

Please note that the actual code syntax may vary based on the version of IDL you are using.
