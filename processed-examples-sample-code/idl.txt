Use Case: Interactive Data Language (IDL)
Code details and examples:
IDL is a programming language primarily used for data analysis and visualization in scientific research and engineering fields. Below is an example of how to load and visualize a sample data file using IDL.

Sample input file (data.txt):
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

Code to load and plot data in IDL:
```idl
; Load data from file
data = fltarr(3, 3)
openr, lun, 'data.txt', /get_lun
readf, lun, data
free_lun, lun

; Plot data
plot_image, data
```

Command to run the script:
```
idl script.pro
```
