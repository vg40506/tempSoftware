I believe you may be asking about dealing with imbalanced datasets in machine learning. There are several techniques and libraries available to address this issue.

Use Case: Dealing with imbalanced datasets
Code details and examples:
1. Python libraries such as `imbalanced-learn` provides various tools to deal with imbalanced datasets. Here is an example on how to use the Random Over Sampler from `imbalanced-learn`:
```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your training data
ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=0)
X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

2. Another popular technique is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which generates synthetic samples to balance the dataset. Here's an example using `imbalanced-learn`:
```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

smote = SMOTE(random_state=0)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

3. If you are using scikit-learn, you can also use the `class_weight` parameter in many classifiers that allows assigning different weights to different classes.

4. Ensemble methods like BalancedRandomForestClassifier in `imbalanced-learn` can also be used:
```python
from imblearn.ensemble import BalancedRandomForestClassifier

brf = BalancedRandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
brf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

These are just a few examples of how to handle imbalanced datasets in machine learning. Each technique may be more suitable depending on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the problem you are trying to solve.
