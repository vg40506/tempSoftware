Use Case: KaHIP is a parallel graph partitioning software that is used to efficiently partition large-scale graphs. 

Code details and examples: 
KaHIP requires a METIS graph format (.graph) as input. Below is an example of a sample input file in METIS format:

```
10 15
2 4 1
1 3
2 4 6
1 3 5
4 2 6
5
```

To run KaHIP on the input file, you can use the following command: 

```
./kaffpa input_file.graph --k 2
```

This command partitions the graph in the input_file.graph into 2 parts.

Please note that the above command is an illustrative example, and the actual command may vary based on the specific options and parameters you want to use with KaHIP.
