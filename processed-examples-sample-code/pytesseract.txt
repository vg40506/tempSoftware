Use Case: pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine, which is used for optical character recognition.

Code details and examples:
```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Load an image from file
image = Image.open('sample_image.png')

# Use pytesseract to extract text from the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

print(text)
```

Note: You need to have Tesseract-OCR installed on your system for pytesseract to work properly.
