Use Case: BEDOPS: BEDOPS is a suite of tools to address common questions raised by large-scale genomic studies by intersecting, merging, and comparing genomic intervals.

Code details and examples:
1. Intersect two BED files:
```bash
bedops file1.bed file2.bed > intersected.bed
```

2. Merge overlapping intervals in a BED file:
```bash
bedops --merge file.bed > merged.bed
```

3. Find intervals in A (file1.bed) that are not present in B (file2.bed):
```bash
bedops --difference file1.bed file2.bed > diff.bed
```
