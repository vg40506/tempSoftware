Use Case: Bayesian analysis using JAGS
Code details and examples:
JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is a program for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Here is an example of how you can run a simple JAGS model in R using the `rjags` package.

```R
# Install and load the rjags package
install.packages("rjags")
library(rjags)

# Sample input data
data <- list(y = c(0,1,0,1,0), n = 5)

# Write the JAGS model
model_string <- "
model {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    y[i] ~ dbern(p)
  }
  p ~ dbeta(1,1)
}
"

# Compile the model
model <- jags.model(textConnection(model_string), data = data, n.chains = 3)

# Burn-in and run the MCMC chains
update(model, 1000)
samples <- coda.samples(model, c("p"), 10000)

# Summary of the posterior distribution
summary(samples)
```

Command to run the code:
You can paste the above code in an R script and run it in an R environment.

Please note that this is just a simple example. More complex models and analyses can be performed using JAGS.
