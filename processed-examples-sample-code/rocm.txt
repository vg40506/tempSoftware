Use Case: High Performance Computing Software
Code details and examples: 
ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) is an open-source software platform for AMD GPUs. It provides a foundation to support HPC and AI workloads.  

To run a sample program using ROCm, you can use the following steps:

1. Write a sample OpenCL program (e.g., vector_add.cpp) using a code editor:

```cpp
#include <CL/cl.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Initializing OpenCL
    // Add your OpenCL code here
    return 0;
}
```

2. Compile the program using the ROCm compiler (e.g., `hipcc` for ROCm):

```bash
hipcc vector_add.cpp -o vector_add
```

3. Run the compiled program:

```bash
./vector_add
```
