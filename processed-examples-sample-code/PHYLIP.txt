Use Case: PHYLIP is a free package of programs for inferring phylogenies. It includes programs for phylogenetic inference using various methods, such as distance matrix, parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian.

Code details and examples:
- Example of using the "neighbor" program in PHYLIP:
```
$ neighbor < input_file
```
- Example of input file for the "neighbor" program:
```
5
SpeciesA  0.0  0.3  0.4  0.7
SpeciesB  0.3  0.0  0.5  0.8
SpeciesC  0.4  0.5  0.0  0.45
SpeciesD  0.7  0.8  0.45 0.0
```

- Example of using the "dnaml" program in PHYLIP:
```
$ dnaml < input_file
```
- Example of input file for the "dnaml" program:
```
5  500
1
( (SpeciesA:0.1,SpeciesB:0.2):0.3,(SpeciesC:0.15,SpeciesD:0.25):0.4);
```

Please note that these are just examples and the actual input files may vary based on the specific program and analysis you are conducting within the PHYLIP package.
