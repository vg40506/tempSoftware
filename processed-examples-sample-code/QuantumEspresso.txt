Use Case: QuantumEspresso is an integrated suite of software for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is widely used in computational materials science and condensed-matter physics.

Code details and examples:
Input file format (example input for QuantumEspresso calculations):
- Input file for a simple silicon (Si) band structure calculation named "si.scf.in":

```
&CONTROL
    calculation = 'scf',
    prefix = 'si',
    pseudo_dir = '/path/to/pseudopotentials/',
    outdir = '/path/to/output/files/'

&SYSTEM
    ibrav = 2,
    celldm(1) = 10.26,
    nat = 1,
    ntyp = 1,
    ecutwfc = 30.0,
    occupations = 'fixed'

&ELECTRONS
    conv_thr = 1e-8

ATOMIC_SPECIES
    Si  28.085  Si.pbe-n-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF

ATOMIC_POSITIONS crystal
    Si 0.00 0.00 0.00

K_POINTS automatic
    10 10 10 0 0 0
```

Code to run QuantumEspresso (assuming QuantumEspresso is installed and included in the system's PATH):
```
mpirun -np 4 pw.x -input si.scf.in > si.scf.out
```

In this example, `mpirun` is used for parallel execution with 4 MPI processes, `pw.x` is the QuantumEspresso executable, and `-input si.scf.in` specifies the input file. The output of the calculation is redirected to `si.scf.out`.

Note: Please adjust the input file parameters (e.g., paths to pseudopotentials, output directories, pseudopotential filenames) according to your specific setup and requirements.
