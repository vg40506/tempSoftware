Use Case: Bedtools is a powerful open-source software for working with genomic intervals.

Code details and examples:

Bedtools intersect - finding overlapping intervals between two BED files

Input file 1 (file1.bed):
```
chr1 100 200
chr1 300 400
```

Input file 2 (file2.bed):
```
chr1 150 250
chr1 350 450
```

Command:
```
bedtools intersect -a file1.bed -b file2.bed
```

Output:
```
chr1 150 200
chr1 350 400
```

There are various other subcommands in bedtools like merging intervals, finding coverage, comparing files, etc.
