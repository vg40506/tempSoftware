Use Case: Quantum chemistry calculations with ORCA software.

Code details and examples:
ORCA is a quantum chemistry software package often used for ab initio calculations of molecular systems. It supports a wide range of quantum chemical methods including DFT, MP2, CCSD(T), and more.

To run ORCA, you typically provide it with an input file containing the necessary information for your calculation. Here is an example input file for a simple energy calculation of a water molecule:

Input file (water.inp):
```
! HF/6-31G calculation for water
%pal nprocs 4 end
%maxcore 2048
* xyz 0 1
O  0.000000  0.000000  0.117307
H  0.000000  0.755450 -0.469226
H  0.000000 -0.755450 -0.469226
*
```

You can then run ORCA using a command similar to the following:

Command to run ORCA:
```
orca water.inp > water.out
```

This command will run the ORCA calculation using the input file "water.inp" and write the output to "water.out".

Please note that the actual command to run ORCA may vary based on your specific installation and system setup.
