Use Case: HMMER is a software suite for protein sequence analysis using profile hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Code details and examples:
1. **Create an HMM profile**: 
```bash
hmmbuild my_profile.hmm my_sequence.fasta
```
Input: A multiple sequence alignment file in fasta format (my_sequence.fasta)
Output: The created HMM profile file (my_profile.hmm)

2. **Search for sequences using an HMM profile**:
```bash
hmmsearch my_profile.hmm my_database.fasta
```
Input: HMM profile file (my_profile.hmm) and a database of protein sequences in fasta format (my_database.fasta)
Output: List of sequences from the database that match the HMM profile

3. **Scan a sequence using an HMM profile**:
```bash
hmmscan my_profile.hmm my_sequence.fasta
```
Input: HMM profile file (my_profile.hmm) and a single sequence in fasta format (my_sequence.fasta)
Output: Match statistics for the sequence against the HMM profile

Note: These are just basic examples, and HMMER provides various other functionalities and options for advanced usage. Make sure to check the HMMER documentation for more details.
