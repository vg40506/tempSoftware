Use Case: BAM file manipulation

Code details and examples:
BamTools is a C++ API and toolkit for manipulating BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) files. Below is an example of how to use BamTools to extract reads from a BAM file.

```cpp
#include "api/BamReader.h"
#include "api/BamAlignment.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    BamTools::BamReader reader;
    if (!reader.Open("input.bam")) {
        std::cerr << "Error opening BAM file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    BamTools::BamAlignment al;
    while (reader.GetNextAlignment(al)) {
        // Process the alignment
        // For example, print the read name
        std::cout << al.Name << std::endl;
    }

    reader.Close();
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the above code (assuming the BamTools library is correctly installed), you can use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o extract_reads extract_reads.cpp -lbamtools
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./extract_reads
```

This will read the BAM file "input.bam" and print the read names to the standard output.

Please note that you may need to adjust the include paths and library paths based on your installation of BamTools.
