Use Case: libunistring is a C library for manipulating Unicode strings and for processing textual data in different encoding forms.

Code details and examples:
libunistring provides various functions for manipulating Unicode strings, such as converting between different encoding forms, case conversion, normalization, and more. Below is a simple example of how to use the libunistring library to convert a UTF-8 string to a UTF-16 string.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistr.h>

int main() {
    const char *utf8_string = "Hello, World!"; // Input UTF-8 string
    int utf16_length = 2 * strlen(utf8_string) + 2;
    uint16_t utf16_string[utf16_length]; // Output UTF-16 string

    u8_strto32(utf8_string, utf16_string, utf16_length); // Convert UTF-8 to UTF-16

    // Print the UTF-16 string
    for (int i = 0; utf16_string[i] != 0; i++) {
        printf("%04X ", utf16_string[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the above program, you can use a command similar to the one below (the exact command may vary based on your system):

```bash
gcc example.c -o example -lunistring
```

Then, you can run the compiled executable:

```bash
./example
```

This is a simple example to demonstrate the basic usage of libunistring for converting a UTF-8 string to a UTF-16 string. The library provides many more functions for Unicode string manipulation, and you can refer to the official documentation for more details and examples.
