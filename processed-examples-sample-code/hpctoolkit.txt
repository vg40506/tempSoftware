Use Case: Profiling an application with HPC Toolkit

Code details and examples:
1. Example input files:
- Sample C program (sample.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<=100; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

2. Command to compile the program:
```bash
gcc -o sample sample.c
```

3. Command to profile the program using HPC Toolkit (assuming HPC Toolkit is installed):
```bash
hpcrun ./sample
```

4. Command to view the profiling results:
```bash
hpcviewer hpctoolkit-sample-database/
```

Note: The commands and steps above may vary depending on the specific version of HPC Toolkit and installation setup. Make sure to refer to the official documentation for more detailed information.
