Use Case: Basespace  

Code details and examples:  
Basespace is a cloud-based platform for analyzing and managing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Users can upload their NGS data to Basespace and perform various analyses using pre-built applications or custom workflows.

An example of using Basespace is to upload FASTQ files for analysis. The input files should be in FASTQ format, containing sequencing data and quality scores.

To upload FASTQ files to Basespace, users can use the Basespace Web interface or the Basespace CLI (Command Line Interface). Below is a code snippet for using the Basespace CLI to upload FASTQ files:

```
bs upload <project_ID> /path/to/file.fastq
```

In the code snippet above, `<project_ID>` should be replaced with the ID of the Basespace project where the files will be uploaded, and `/path/to/file.fastq` should be replaced with the path to the FASTQ file on the local system.

After uploading the files, users can then use various Basespace applications or workflows to analyze the data further.
