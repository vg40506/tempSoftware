Use Case: BioPerl is a collection of Perl modules that are used to write Perl scripts for bioinformatics applications.

Code details and examples:
BioPerl provides modules for handling various biological data types such as sequences, alignments, and phylogenetic trees. Below is an example script using BioPerl to read a FASTA file and print out the sequences:

```perl
use Bio::SeqIO;

my $input_file = "sequences.fasta";
my $seqio = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => $input_file, -format => "fasta");

while (my $seq = $seqio->next_seq) {
    my $id = $seq->display_id;
    my $sequence = $seq->seq;
    
    print "Sequence ID: $id\n";
    print "Sequence: $sequence\n";
}
```

To run the script, save it in a file (e.g., `read_fasta.pl`) and run it using the Perl interpreter:
```
perl read_fasta.pl
```
