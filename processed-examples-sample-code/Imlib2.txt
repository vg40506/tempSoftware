Imlib2 library for image manipulation. 

Use Case: Image loading and manipulation with Imlib2
Code details and examples:

Imlib2 is a library for loading, saving, and manipulating images in various formats. Here is an example of using Imlib2 to load and save an image in C:

```c
#include <Imlib2.h>

int main() {
    // Load an image
    Imlib_Image image = imlib_load_image("input.jpg");
    
    // Modify the image here if needed
    
    // Save the modified image
    imlib_save_image_with_error_return(image, "output.jpg", NULL);
    
    // Free the image
    imlib_free_image();
    
    return 0;
}
```

For input files, you would need an image file in a supported format such as jpg, png, bmp, etc.

To compile the C code, you can use the following command:
```
gcc -o image_manipulation image_manipulation.c -lImlib2
```

To run the program (assuming the executable file is named 'image_manipulation'):
```
./image_manipulation
```
