Use Case: Electronic structure calculations with GULP

Code details and examples:
GULP (General Utility Lattice Program) is a software package for performing a variety of types of atomistic simulation. It is commonly used for calculating the electronic structure of materials. GULP can be used for a range of simulations including geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, and calculation of electronic properties.

Sample input file (input.gin):
```
# GULP input file for electronic structure calculation
