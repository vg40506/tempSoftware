Use Case: tqdm is a Python library that provides a fast, extensible progress bar for loops and other iterable tasks.

Code details and examples:
```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

# Example of using tqdm to show a progress bar for a loop
for i in tqdm(range(10)):
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

This code snippet will output a progress bar that updates as the loop iterates through the range of 10.

Command to run: None, as this is a Python library and does not require a separate run command.
