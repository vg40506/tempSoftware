Use Case: tqdm is a fast, extensible progress bar for loops and more.

Code details and examples:
```
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

# Example of using tqdm in a loop
for i in tqdm(range(10)):
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple loop where tqdm is used to show a progress bar for iterations.
