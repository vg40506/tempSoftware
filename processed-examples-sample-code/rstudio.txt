Use Case: IDE for R programming

Code details and examples:

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. Users can write R scripts, visualize data, and generate reports within RStudio. 

To run a simple R script in RStudio, you can create a new R script file and write the following R code:

```R
# This is a sample R script
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
plot(x, y, main = "Simple Plot", xlab = "x", ylab = "x^2", pch = 16)
```

To run the script in RStudio, you can either click the "Run" button in the script editor or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac). This will execute the script and display the plot in the Plots pane.

You can also directly execute R commands in the Console pane at the bottom of the RStudio interface.

For more complex R programming tasks, RStudio provides a range of tools and features to enhance the workflow of R users.
