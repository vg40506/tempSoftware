Use Case: Greenlet is a lightweight coroutine library for Python.

Code details and examples: 
```python
from greenlet import greenlet

# Define two greenlets
def test1():
    print("Hello from test1")
    gr2.switch()
    print("Goodbye from test1")

def test2():
    print("Hello from test2")
    gr1.switch()
    print("Goodbye from test2")

# Create greenlets
gr1 = greenlet(test1)
gr2 = greenlet(test2)

# Start execution
gr1.switch()
```

In this example, `test1` and `test2` are two functions that switch context back and forth using greenlets.
