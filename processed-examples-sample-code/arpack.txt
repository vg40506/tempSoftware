Use Case: Eigenvalue problem solver using ARPACK library
Code details and examples:

ARPACK (ARnoldi PACKage) is a library for solving large scale eigenvalue problems. It is commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications. Here is an example of how you can use ARPACK to solve an eigenvalue problem:

Sample Input File (input.dat):
```
&ELMETH
   NEV = 2,
   NCV = 10,
   MAXIT = 100,
   TOL = 1.0E-6,
   MODE = 1,
/
```
Sample Python code using scipy's ARPACK wrapper:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigs

# Load your matrix A here
A = np.array([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 2.0]])

# Solve for the two smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors
vals, vecs = eigs(A, k=2, which='SR')

print("Eigenvalues:", vals)
print("Eigenvectors:", vecs)
```

Command to run the script:
```
python eigen_solver.py
```

This is a basic example of how ARPACK can be used through scipy's wrapper to solve eigenvalue problems. The input file contains parameters to control the solver settings like the number of eigenvalues (NEV), the number of Arnoldi vectors (NCV), maximum iterations (MAXIT), tolerance (TOL), and the mode.

Please note that ARPACK is typically used through wrappers like scipy in Python or through interfaces in other programming languages.
