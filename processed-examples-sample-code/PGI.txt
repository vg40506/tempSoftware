Use Case: Compiler for high-performance computing applications

Code details and examples:
- PGI is a compiler suite designed for parallel computing on CPUs and GPUs. It supports Fortran, C, and C++ languages.
- Input files can be in Fortran, C, or C++ source code format.

Example code snippet:
```bash
pgfortran -o my_program my_program.f90
```

In this example, `my_program.f90` is a Fortran source file that will be compiled into an executable named `my_program`.
