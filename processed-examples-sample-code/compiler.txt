Use Case: Compiler
Details: A compiler is a software program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer. Here, I will provide an example of using the GCC compiler to compile a simple C program.
Code:
```c
// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the above C program using GCC:

Command:
```
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

This will create an executable file named "hello" which can be run using:
```
./hello
```
