Use Case: libedit

Code details and examples:
libedit is a library for command-line editing. It is typically used in UNIX-like systems as an alternative to GNU Readline. Here is a basic example of how libedit can be used:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <histedit.h>

int main() {
    EditLine *el = el_init("libedit_example", stdin, stdout, stderr);
    History *hist = history_init();
    HistoryEvent ev;

    el_set(el, EL_PROMPT, &prompt);
    el_set(el, EL_EDITOR, "emacs");

    while (1) {
        const char *line = el_gets(el, NULL);
        if (!line) {
            break;
        }

        history(hist, &ev, H_ENTER, line);
        printf("Received input: %s\n", line);
    }

    history_end(hist);
    el_end(el);
    return 0;
}
```

You can compile the above code with:

```bash
gcc -l edit -o libedit_example libedit_example.c
```

Please note that libedit is a C library, so the above code is written in C.
