Use Case: FastANI is a tool for calculating average nucleotide identity (ANI) using fragmented nucleotide sequences. It is commonly used in microbial genomics for species comparison.

Code details and examples:
1. Input format:
- Multiple FASTA files of nucleotide sequences (*.fa or *.fasta)

2. Example command:
```
fastANI -q query_genome.fasta -r reference_genome.fasta
```

3. Expected output:
- ANI value between the two genomes

4. Sample input files:
query_genome.fasta:
```
>seq1
AGCTGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGACGT
>seq2
AGCTGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGTAGC
```

reference_genome.fasta:
```
>seq1
AGCTGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGACGT
>seq3
AGCTGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGACGT
```

5. Code snippet explanation:
- Use the fastANI tool with the query genome file and reference genome file to calculate the ANI value between the two genomes.

Note: The above command is a general example. Please refer to the specific documentation for more options and parameters.
