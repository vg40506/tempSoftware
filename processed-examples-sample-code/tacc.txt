Use Case: TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center) software, including various HPC tools and libraries.

Code details and examples:
1. Stampede2 supercomputer at TACC:
   - Stampede2 is a supercomputer at TACC for high-performance computing.
   - To submit a job on Stampede2, you can create a PBS script (e.g., job.pbs) with job specifications and submit it using the sbatch command.
   
Sample job.pbs script:
```
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N myjob
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
module load intel
module load impi
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
mpirun -np 16 myapplication
```

Submit the job using the sbatch command:
```
sbatch job.pbs
```

2. Parallel programming with MPI on Stampede2:
   - You can write MPI programs in C or Fortran and compile them with MPI compiler wrappers provided by TACC.
   
Sample MPI C program (hello.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int rank, size;

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    printf("Hello from rank %d of %d\n", rank, size);

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run the MPI program:
```
mpicc -o hello hello.c
ibrun hello
```

3. Python libraries and tools at TACC:
   - TACC provides various Python libraries and tools for scientific computing and data analysis on their systems.
   - You can load Python modules using the module command.
   
Example command to load Python 3 module:
```
module load python3
```

4. Bioinformatics tools at TACC:
   - TACC offers bioinformatics software and tools for analyzing biological data.
   - You can search the TACC user guide or documentation for specific bioinformatics tools available.

5. Compiler tools at TACC:
   - TACC provides various compiler tools for programming on their systems, such as Intel compilers.
   - You can load the compiler module and compile your code using the appropriate compiler commands.

Example command to load Intel compilers module:
```
module load intel
```
