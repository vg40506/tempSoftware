Use Case: Count k-mers in DNA/RNA sequences.

Code details and examples:
Jellyfish is a tool for fast counting of k-mers in DNA/RNA sequences. Here is an example of how you can count k-mers in a DNA sequence using Jellyfish:

**Input File (example.fasta):**
```
>sequence1
ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT
>sequence2
CGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC
```

**Counting k-mers using Jellyfish:**
```bash
jellyfish count -m 5 -s 100M -o kmer_counts.jf example.fasta
```

In this example:
- "-m 5" specifies that we are counting 5-mers.
- "-s 100M" specifies the size of the hash table.
- "-o kmer_counts.jf" specifies the output file where the counts will be stored.
- "example.fasta" is the input file containing DNA sequences.

**Querying k-mer counts from output:**
```bash
jellyfish dump kmer_counts.jf
```

This will output the k-mer counts stored in the kmer_counts.jf file.
