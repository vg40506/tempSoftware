Use Case: cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and manipulating data using a pandas-like API. 

Code details and examples:
Sample input file format (CSV):
```
id,name,age
1,Alice,25
2,Bob,30
3,Charlie,35
```

Sample code to read a CSV file using cuDF:
```python
import cudf

# Read CSV file
df = cudf.read_csv('input.csv')

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```

To run the code, make sure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and cuDF installed on your system.
