Use Case: Trim adapters from sequencing reads.

Code details and examples:
```
# Install cutadapt (if not already installed)
# pip install cutadapt

# Trim adapters from paired-end sequencing reads
cutadapt -a ADAPTER_FWD -A ADAPTER_REV -o output_fwd.fastq -p output_rev.fastq input_fwd.fastq input_rev.fastq

# Trim adapters from single-end sequencing reads
cutadapt -a ADAPTER -o output.fastq input.fastq
```

Input file format:
- For paired-end reads:
  - input_fwd.fastq: FASTQ file containing forward reads
  - input_rev.fastq: FASTQ file containing reverse reads
- For single-end reads:
  - input.fastq: FASTQ file containing sequencing reads

Specifications:
- ADAPTER_FWD, ADAPTER_REV, ADAPTER: The sequences of the adapters to be trimmed.

Note:
- Replace ADAPTER_FWD, ADAPTER_REV, ADAPTER with the actual adapter sequences.

Command to run:
- Replace the input and output file names and adapter sequences, then run the provided command in the terminal.
