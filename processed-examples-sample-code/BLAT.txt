Use Case: BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) is a sequence alignment tool that is commonly used in bioinformatics for comparing sequences.

Code details and examples:
BLAT can be run through command line with the following command:
```
blat <database> <query> <output>
```
- `<database>`: The file containing the sequences to search against.
- `<query>`: The file containing the query sequence.
- `<output>`: The output file to store the results of the alignment.

Sample input files:
- Database file (example.fasta):
```
>seq1
ATCGTACGTA
>seq2
TACGTACGTA
```
- Query file (query.fasta):
```
>query1
ATCGTACGTA
```

Example command to run BLAT:
```
blat example.fasta query.fasta output.psl
```
