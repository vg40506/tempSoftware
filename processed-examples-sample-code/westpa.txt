Use Case: Analysis of weighted ensemble simulations
Code details and examples:
WESTPA (Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis) is a software package used for the analysis of weighted ensemble simulations. It can be used to perform various types of analysis on the data generated from weighted ensemble simulations.

To run WESTPA, you need to provide input files such as a WESTPA control file (west.cfg), a WESTPA system input file (system.h5), and a WESTPA kinetics input file (kinetics.h5). Below is an example of a basic WESTPA control file:

```bash
# west.cfg
[west]
verbosity = high

[system]
# Input file that contains information about the system
file = system.h5

[kinetics]
# Input file that contains information about the kinetics
file = kinetics.h5
```

To run WESTPA, you can use the following command:
```bash
west run west.cfg
```

This command will run WESTPA using the configuration provided in the west.cfg file.

Please note that WESTPA requires a properly configured environment with all dependencies installed.
