Use Case: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is a widely used mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications.

Code details and examples:
```bash
# Command to run WRF:
mpirun ./wrf.exe
```

Input files:
- namelist.input: Configuration file containing settings for the WRF model
- wrfinput_d01: Initial conditions file for the model
- wrfbdy_d01: Boundary conditions file for the model
