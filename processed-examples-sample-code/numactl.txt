Use Case: Controlling NUMA policy for processes

Code details and examples:
NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) is a technique used in multiprocessor systems to improve performance by having each processor access its own local memory. `numactl` is a tool that can be used to run programs with a specific NUMA policy, controlling which memory nodes processes or threads can access.

Sample Input files:
- Specify the memory allocation policy for a command:
  - Node interleaving policy: `numactl --interleave=all command`
  - Bind a command to a specific node: `numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 command`

Command to run:
```
numactl --interleave=all ./my_program
```
This command will run `my_program` with an interleaved memory node policy, allowing it to access memory across all available NUMA nodes.
