Use Case: GLFW
GLFW is a library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.

Code details and examples:
```C
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

int main() {
    GLFWwindow* window;
    
    if (!glfwInit()) {
        return -1;
    }

    window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Example", NULL, NULL);
    
    if (!window) {
        glfwTerminate();
        return -1;
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code with GLFW, you may need to link against the GLFW library. Here is an example compilation command using gcc:

```bash
gcc example.c -o example -lglfw -lGL -lm
```

This assumes that the GLFW library is installed on your system and can be found by the compiler.
