AOCC stands for AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler. It is a high-performance compiler designed for AMD processors.

Use Case: Compile a C code using AOCC compiler
Code details and examples:
```c
// Sample C code (sample.c)
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, AOCC!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the sample C code using AOCC compiler:
```bash
aocc sample.c -o sample
```

This will produce an executable file named `sample` which can be run with `./sample`.

Note: The actual command to use AOCC compiler may vary depending on the specific version and installation location.
