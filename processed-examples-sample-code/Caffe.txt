Caffe is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center. Below is an example of how you can use Caffe for image classification.

Use Case: Image Classification 

Code details and examples:
```python
# Make sure Caffe is properly installed and the required models are available

import caffe
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Load the pre-trained Caffe model
model_def = 'deploy.prototxt'
model_weights = 'model.caffemodel'

net = caffe.Net(model_def, model_weights, caffe.TEST)

# Load and preprocess the input image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
mean_pixel = np.array([104.00698793, 116.66876762, 122.67891434])  # BGR mean values

input_image = resized_image[...,::-1].astype(np.float32) - mean_pixel

# Reshape the input image
net.blobs['data'].data[...] = input_image.transpose((2, 0, 1))

# Perform forward pass
output = net.forward()

# Get the predicted class label
output_prob = output['prob']
predicted_class = np.argmax(output_prob)

print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
```

To run the above code, you need to have Caffe installed on your system with the necessary dependencies. Save the above code to a file, make sure to replace `'deploy.prototxt'`, `'model.caffemodel'`, and `'image.jpg'` with the paths to your deploy prototxt file, model weights file, and input image file respectively. Then you can run the script using a Python interpreter.

Please note that the above code is a simplified example and might need modifications based on the specific model and task you are working with.
