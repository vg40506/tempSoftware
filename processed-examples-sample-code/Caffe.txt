Use Case: Deep learning framework for image classification, segmentation, and other tasks.
Code details and examples: 
Sample input files:
- Model definition file (.prototxt)
- Trained model file (.caffemodel)
- Image files for testing

Code:
To test a trained model on an image using Caffe, you can use the following command:
```
./build/tools/caffe test -model <model_definition_file.prototxt> -weights <trained_model_file.caffemodel> -gpu 0 -iterations 1
```
Make sure to replace `<model_definition_file.prototxt>` and `<trained_model_file.caffemodel>` with the actual file paths.

Note: This is a general command structure, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific setup and requirements.
