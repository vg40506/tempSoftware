Use Case: Image compression and optimization

Code details and examples:

libwebp is a library for handling the WebP image format. Below is an example of how you can use libwebp to compress an image using the command line.

```bash
# Compress an image using libwebp
cwebp input_image.png -o output_image.webp
```

In the above example:
- `input_image.png` is the input image file you want to compress.
- `output_image.webp` is the output WebP image file.

You can also specify additional options such as quality settings and compression levels. More information about additional options can be found in the libwebp documentation.
