XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular machine learning library that is known for its speed and performance in gradient boosting framework. It is widely used in machine learning competitions and industry applications.

Use Case: XGBoost can be used for classification and regression tasks.

Code details and examples:

**Installation:**
```
pip install xgboost
```

**Sample Input File:**
```
# Importing the necessary libraries
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Loading the dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Converting the data into DMatrix objects
dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, label=y_train)
dtest = xgb.DMatrix(X_test, label=y_test)
```

**Training a Model:**
```
# Defining the parameters for XGBoost model
params = {
    'objective': 'binary:logistic',
    'eval_metric': 'logloss',
    'max_depth': 3
}

# Training the XGBoost model
bst = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=100)
```

**Making Predictions:**
```
# Making predictions on the test set
predictions = bst.predict(dtest)
```

**Command to Run:**
- Since XGBoost is a Python library, the code can be run directly in a Python environment.
