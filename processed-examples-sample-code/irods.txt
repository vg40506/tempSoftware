Use Case: Data management and sharing software.

Code details and examples:
- iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) is a data management system that allows users to organize, share, and manage large volumes of data across different storage systems and networks.

- To interact with iRODS, you can use the iCommands which provide a set of command-line utilities for managing data within an iRODS system.

Example of using the icd command to change to a specific iRODS collection (directory):
```
icd /<irodsZone>/home/<username>/data
```

Example of using the iput command to upload a file to iRODS:
```
iput /path/to/local/file.txt /<irodsZone>/home/<username>/data/file.txt
```

Example of using the iget command to download a file from iRODS:
```
iget /<irodsZone>/home/<username>/data/file.txt /path/to/local/file.txt
```

These are just a few examples of using iCommands with iRODS. The full list of iCommands and their usage can be found in the iRODS documentation.
