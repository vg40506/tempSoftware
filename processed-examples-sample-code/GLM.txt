I assume you are referring to the Generalized Linear Models (GLM) package in the R statistical software. 

Use Case: Fitting a Poisson regression model using GLM in R
Code details and examples:
```R
# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  counts = c(18, 21, 16, 28, 37),
  treatment = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A"))
)

# Fitting a Poisson regression model
model <- glm(counts ~ treatment, data = data, family = "poisson")

# Getting summary of the model
summary(model)
```

In the above code snippet, we are fitting a Poisson regression model using the GLM function in R to evaluate the impact of treatment on counts data. The `counts` variable represents the response variable, and `treatment` is the predictor variable.

To run the above code snippet, you need to have R installed on your system. You can use RStudio or any other R environment to execute the code.
