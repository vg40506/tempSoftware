Use Case: GLM (Generalized Linear Modeling)

Code details and examples:
GLM is a commonly used statistical method for fitting a variety of statistical models. It can be implemented in different programming languages such as R, Python, and SAS.

Sample input file: 
The input file for GLM typically includes a dataset with predictor variables and a response variable. For example, in a CSV format:
```
age,income,gender,insurance_claim
45,60000,Male,Yes
32,40000,Female,No
...

```

Code snippet in R:
```R
# Load data
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Fit a generalized linear model
model <- glm(insurance_claim ~ age + income + gender, data = data, family = binomial)

# Print model summary
summary(model)
```

Command to run for R:
```R
Rscript script.R
```

Code snippet in Python using statsmodels library:
```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Fit a generalized linear model
model = sm.GLM(data['insurance_claim'], sm.add_constant(data[['age', 'income', 'gender']]), family=sm.families.Binomial()).fit()

# Print model summary
print(model.summary())
```

Command to run for Python:
```bash
python script.py
```
