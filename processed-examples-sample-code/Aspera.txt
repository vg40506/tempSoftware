Use Case: High-speed file transfer software for HPC environments.
Code details and examples: 
Aspera provides a command line tool called "ascp" to transfer files at high speed. To transfer a file using ascp, you can use the following command:
```
ascp <source_file> <destination_user>@<destination_host>:<destination_path>
```
For example:
```
ascp input.txt user@example.com:/home/user/data/
```
