Use Case: NCO (NetCDF Operators)
  
Code details and examples:
NCO is a set of command-line tools for working with NetCDF files commonly used in climate data analysis. Below is a simple example of extracting a variable from a NetCDF file using NCO.

```bash
# Extract a variable from a NetCDF file
ncks -v variable input_file.nc output_file.nc
```

In this command:
- `ncks`: NCO command for extracting or manipulating variables in NetCDF files.
- `-v variable`: Specifies the variable you want to extract.
- `input_file.nc`: Input NetCDF file.
- `output_file.nc`: Output NetCDF file with the extracted variable.

Note: NCO provides a wide range of functionalities for working with NetCDF files, such as concatenating, averaging, selecting, and more.
