Use Case: NetCDF Operators (NCO) is a suite of command-line tools for manipulating and analyzing NetCDF files.

Code details and examples:
NCO provides a wide range of functionalities for working with NetCDF files. Here is an example of how you can use NCO to extract a variable from a NetCDF file:

```bash
ncap2 -s "output_variable=input_variable" input_file.nc output_file.nc
```

In this example, `ncap2` is the NCO operator used to create a new variable (`output_variable`) by assigning it the values of an existing variable (`input_variable`) from the input file (`input_file.nc`). The resulting NetCDF file will be saved as `output_file.nc`.

For more information on NCO and its capabilities, you can refer to the official NCO documentation: http://nco.sourceforge.net/
