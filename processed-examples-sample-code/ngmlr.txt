Use Case: ngmlr is a long-read mapper designed to align PacBio or Nanopore long reads. 

Code details and examples:
```
# Command to align PacBio/Nanopore reads to a reference genome
ngmlr -t 8 -r reference.fasta -q reads.fastq -o alignments.sam
```

Input files:
- reference.fasta: Reference genome in FASTA format
- reads.fastq: PacBio or Nanopore reads in FASTQ format

Output file:
- alignments.sam: SAM file containing the alignments of reads to the reference genome
