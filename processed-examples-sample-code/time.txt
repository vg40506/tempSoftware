Use Case: time command in Unix/Linux systems
Code details and examples:
The `time` command is used to determine the amount of time taken by a command to run. It is helpful in measuring the performance of different commands and programs.

Example:
```
time ls
```

Output:
```
file1  file2  file3
real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s
```

In the above example, the `time` command was used to measure the time taken by the `ls` command to list files in the directory. The output shows three different time measurements: real (actual clock time), user (CPU time spent in user mode), and sys (CPU time spent in kernel mode).
