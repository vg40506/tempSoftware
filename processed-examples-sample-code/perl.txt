Use Case: Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.

Code details and examples:
- Below is a simple Perl script that reads a text file and prints its contents:
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file = "input.txt";

open(my $fh, '<', $file) or die "Cannot open file $file: $!";
while (my $line = <$fh>) {
    chomp $line;
    print "$line\n";
}
close($fh);
```

- Sample input file "input.txt":
```
Hello, this is sample text file.
This is line 2.
```

- To run the Perl script:
```
perl script.pl
```

- Output will be:
```
Hello, this is sample text file.
This is line 2.
```
