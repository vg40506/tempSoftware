I can provide information on ANSYS Fluent, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software commonly used in the industry for simulating fluid flow and heat transfer. 

Use Case: Simulating flow over a cylinder
Code details and examples:
```text
% ANSYS Fluent input file for simulating flow over a cylinder
% Define geometry, mesh, boundary conditions, and solver settings

/case/cylinderflow

/grid/import meshfile "cylinder_mesh.msh"

/solve/set/discretization-scheme "second-order"

/bc/velocity-inlet
0.2 0 0

/bc/pressure-outlet
0

/solve/initialize/initialize-flow
/solve/iterate 1000

/report/force-drag-lift

/solve/dual-time-iterate 1000 0.001

/display/contour velocity-magnitude
```

To execute the ANSYS Fluent simulation with the provided input file, you would typically launch the Fluent graphical user interface (GUI), open the input file, set the appropriate solver options, and click on the "Compute" button to start the simulation iteration process.

Note: The above input file is a simplified example and may need adjustments based on the actual simulation requirements.
