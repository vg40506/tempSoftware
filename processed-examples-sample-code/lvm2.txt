As LVM2 is a set of user-space tools for managing logical volume management, here is an example use case and code details for creating a logical volume using LVM2.

Use Case: Create a logical volume using LVM2
Code details and examples:

1. Create a Physical Volume (PV):
```bash

```

2. Create a Volume Group (VG):
```bash
vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdX
```

3. Create a Logical Volume (LV):
```bash
lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg
```

4. Format the Logical Volume:
```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
```

5. Mount the Logical Volume:
```bash
mkdir /mnt/my_lv
mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt/my_lv
```

Note: Replace `/dev/sdX` with the appropriate block device in your system.

Keep in mind that it's essential to have the LVM2 tools installed in your system before running these commands.
