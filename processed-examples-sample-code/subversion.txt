Use Case: Subversion (SVN) is a version control system used for managing software projects and their source code files.

Code details and examples:
1. Create a new SVN repository:
```
svnadmin create /path/to/repository
```

2. Checkout a copy of the repository:
```
svn checkout file:///path/to/repository
```

3. Add files to the repository:
```
svn add file.txt
svn commit -m "Adding a new file"
```

4. Update files from the repository:
```
svn update
```

5. View the commit history:
```
svn log
```

6. Revert changes made to a file:
```
svn revert file.txt
```

7. Merge changes from one branch to another:
```
svn merge -r start_revision:end_revision source_branch target_branch
```

8. Export a clean copy of the repository:
```
svn export /path/to/repository /path/to/export/folder
```

9. List all files and directories in the repository:
```
svn list file:///path/to/repository
```

10. Delete a file from the repository:
```
svn delete file.txt
svn commit -m "Removing a file"
```

Please note that these commands are examples and may need to be adjusted based on your specific use case and repository structure.
