Use Case: Perform a nucleotide database search using BLAST.

Code details and examples:
```
# Example input file (query sequence in FASTA format)
query.fasta:
>QuerySequence
ATCGATCGATCGATCG

# Running BLAST with the query file against the nt database
blastn -query query.fasta -db nt -out output.txt -outfmt 6
```

Note: Make sure to replace `query.fasta` with the actual path to your query sequence file and adjust the database and output options as needed.
