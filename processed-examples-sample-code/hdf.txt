Use Case: HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format)

Code details and examples:
Sample input file (example.h5):
```
# Create an HDF5 file with a dataset
import h5py

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
with h5py.File('example.h5', 'w') as f:
    dataset = f.create_dataset('data', data=data)
```

Sample code to read the dataset from the HDF5 file:
```
# Read dataset from HDF5 file
import h5py

with h5py.File('example.h5', 'r') as f:
    data = f['data'][:]
    print(data)
```

Command to run the code:
```
python your_script.py
```

Please note that you need to have the h5py package installed for the above code snippets to work.
