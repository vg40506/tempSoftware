Zoltan is a software library for parallel partitioning, load balancing, and parallel adaptive mesh refinement.

Use Case: Parallel partitioning and load balancing
Code details and examples:
```c++
#include "zoltan.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    float x[5] = {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    float y[5] = {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    int global_ids[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    
    int num_objs = 5;
    int num_dims = 2;
    
    float *partition_measure = NULL; // Array used to pass partitioning constraints
    
    struct Zoltan_Struct *zz = Zoltan_Create(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    
    Zoltan_Set_Param(zz, "LB_METHOD", "GRAPH");
    
    int changes, numGidEntries, numLidEntries, numImport, numExport;
    ZOLTAN_ID_PTR importGlobalGids = NULL, importLocalGids = NULL;
    int *importProcs = NULL, *importToLocal = NULL;
    
    Zoltan_LB_Partition(zz, num_dims, num_objs, 0, 0, partition_measure, 
                        &changes, &numGidEntries, &numLidEntries, 
                        &numImport, &importGlobalGids, &importLocalGids, 
                        &importProcs, &importToLocal);

    Zoltan_Destroy(&zz);
    
    return 0;
}
```

To run the code, you would typically compile it with the Zoltan library included. For example, if you have a file named `example.cpp`, you could compile it with a command like:
```bash
mpicxx example.cpp -I/your/zoltan/include/path -L/your/zoltan/lib/path -lzoltan -o example
```
where `/your/zoltan/include/path` and `/your/zoltan/lib/path` should be replaced with the actual paths to the Zoltan library on your system.
