Use Case: Abseil, a common collection of C++ code developed and used at Google.

Input file format: N/A

Code details and examples:
Abseil provides various C++ libraries, such as string manipulation, debugging and testing utilities. Here is an example of using Abseil's string manipulation library:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "absl/strings/str_cat.h"

int main() {
    std::string str = absl::StrCat("Hello", " ", "World!");
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

You would need to have Abseil installed and properly set up in your C++ project to use the code above.
