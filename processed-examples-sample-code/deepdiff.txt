DeepDiff is a Python library for calculating the difference between two objects. It can be used in various scenarios such as data analysis, testing, debugging, etc.

Use Case: Finding the difference between two dictionaries using DeepDiff
Code details and examples:

```python
from deepdiff import DeepDiff

# Sample input dictionaries
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
dict2 = {"a": 1, "b": 3, "d": 4}

# Finding the difference between two dictionaries
diff = DeepDiff(dict1, dict2)

# Printing the result
print(diff)
```

Output:
```
{
    'values_changed': {
        "root['b']": {
            'new_value': 3,
            'old_value': 2
        },
        "root['c']": 3,
        "root['d']": 4
    },
    'dictionary_item_added': {
        "root['d']": 4
    },
    'dictionary_item_removed': {
        "root['c']": 3
    }
}
```

Command to run the code: `python script.py`
