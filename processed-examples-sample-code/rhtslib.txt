Use Case: Tool for working with HTSlib (C library for high-throughput sequencing data formats).

Code details and examples:
RHTSlib provides a Python interface to HTSlib, allowing users to work with BAM, CRAM, and VCF files. Here is an example code snippet using rhtslib to retrieve reads from a BAM file:

```python
from rhtslib import BamReader

bam_file = "example.bam"
reader = BamReader(bam_file)

for read in reader.fetch("chr1", 0, 100):
    print(read)
```

In this example, we are using rhtslib to open a BAM file "example.bam" and fetch reads from chromosome "chr1" between positions 0 and 100. The "read" object contains information about each read, such as sequence, quality scores, alignment information, etc.

To install rhtslib, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install rhtslib
```

Please note that you need to have HTSlib installed on your system for rhtslib to work properly.
