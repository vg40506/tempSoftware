Use Case: Cython is a programming language that makes it easy to write C extensions for Python.

Code details and examples:

```python
# example.pyx
def add_numbers(int a, int b):
    return a + b
```

To compile the Cython code:

```bash
cythonize -i example.pyx
```

To use the compiled Cython code in Python:

```python
# main.py
from example import add_numbers

result = add_numbers(10, 20)
print(result)
```

To compile and run the Python code:

```bash
python main.py
```
