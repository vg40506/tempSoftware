Use Case: Captum is an open-source library to interpret and analyze the predictions of neural networks. It provides various attribution algorithms to understand the importance of input features on the model's output.

Code details and examples:
Captum can be used with PyTorch to analyze the model's behavior. Here is an example of using Captum with a simple PyTorch model:

First, install captum:
```bash
pip install captum
```

Then, you can use Captum to calculate feature attributions. Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to use Captum to calculate Integrated Gradients for a PyTorch model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from captum.attr import IntegratedGradients

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Create input data
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10, requires_grad=True)

# Create IntegratedGradients object
ig = IntegratedGradients(model)

# Calculate feature attributions
attributions = ig.attribute(input_data, target=0)

print("Feature Attributions:", attributions)
```

In this example, we first define a simple PyTorch model and create an input tensor. We then use Captum's IntegratedGradients algorithm to calculate feature attributions for the input_data tensor.

Please note that the above code is a simple example to demonstrate the usage of Captum. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the SimpleModel with your own neural network model.
