Use Case: GIS Mapping
Code details and examples:
ArcGIS is a powerful geographic information system (GIS) software used for creating, analyzing, and managing spatial data. It supports various file formats for input such as shapefiles, GeoTIFF, and CSV files. Here is an example of using ArcGIS to perform a spatial analysis using a shapefile as input:

Sample Input File: input_data.shp
Format: ESRI Shapefile
Details: Contains polygons representing different regions with attributes such as population and area.

Sample Code:
```python
import arcpy

# Set the workspace
arcpy.env.workspace = "C:/data"

# Perform spatial analysis
arcpy.analysis.Buffer("input_data.shp", "output_data.shp", "10 Kilometers")
```

Command to run:
This is an example of running a Python script with ArcGIS capabilities. You can run this script using the ArcGIS Python window or any Python environment with ArcPy installed.
