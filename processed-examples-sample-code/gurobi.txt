Use Case: Mathematical optimization using Gurobi

Code details and examples:
```python
# Sample input file (problem.lp)
Maximize
 obj: x1 + 2 x2 + 3 x3
Subject To
 c1: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 5
 c2: x1 + 2 x2 + 3 x3 <= 10
Bounds
 0 <= x1 <= 4
 0 <= x2 <= 3
 0 <= x3 <= 2
General
 x1 x2 x3
End

# Python code to solve the optimization problem
import gurobipy as gp

# Read the LP file
model = gp.read('problem.lp')

# Optimize the model
model.optimize()

# Print the optimal solution
if model.status == gp.GRB.OPTIMAL:
    for v in model.getVars():
        print(f'{v.varName}: {v.x}')
    print(f'Objective Value: {model.objVal}')
```

To run the code snippet with Gurobi installed, save the LP file as 'problem.lp' and run the Python script.
