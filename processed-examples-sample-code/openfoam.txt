Use Case: Computational fluid dynamics simulation using OpenFOAM

Code details and examples:
OpenFOAM is an open-source computational fluid dynamics software package. Here is an example of running a simple channel flow simulation using OpenFOAM:

1. Create a case directory and set up the geometry and initial conditions:
```bash
mkdir channelFlow
cd channelFlow
cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/simpleFoam/pitzDaily .
blockMesh
```

2. Run the simulation:
```bash
simpleFoam
```

3. Post-process the results:
```bash
paraFoam
```

This is a basic example, and OpenFOAM offers various solvers, utilities, and pre-processing tools for complex fluid flow simulations. The input files and formats can vary depending on the specific simulation setup.
