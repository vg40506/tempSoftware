Use Case: Debugging parallel programs
Code Details and Examples: 
TotalView is a debugger tool used for debugging parallel programs running on clusters or distributed systems. TotalView allows users to inspect variables, set breakpoints, and analyze the behavior of parallel applications.

To use TotalView for debugging, you typically need to compile your program with debugging symbols enabled. Here is an example of compiling a C program using mpicc with debugging symbols:

```bash
mpicc -g -o my_program my_program.c
```

To start debugging a parallel program using TotalView, you can use the following command:

```bash
totalview mpirun -np <num_processes> ./my_program
```

This command will launch the TotalView debugger and attach to the parallel program specified.

Please note that the exact command syntax may vary based on your specific setup and the version of TotalView you are using.
