Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets using the MapReduce programming model.

Use Case: Word Count
Code details and examples:
1. Create a text file with sample input data:
```shell
echo "hello world" > input.txt
echo "world hadoop" >> input.txt
```

2. Run the WordCount example provided with Hadoop:
```shell
hadoop jar hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount input.txt output
```

3. View the output:
```shell
hadoop fs -cat output/part-r-00000
```

This is a basic example to showcase how Hadoop can be used to run a WordCount program on a given input file.
