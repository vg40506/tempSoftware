Use Case: Secure communication with TLS/SSL encryption using GnuTLS library.

Code details and examples:
GnuTLS is a library that provides functions for secure communication over TLS/SSL protocols. Below is an example of how to use GnuTLS in a C program to establish a secure connection with a server:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

int main() {
    gnutls_certificate_credentials_t credentials;
    gnutls_session_t session;
    int ret;

    gnutls_global_init();

    gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials(&credentials);
    gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file(credentials, "server.crt", "server.key", GNUTLS_X509_FMT_PEM);

    gnutls_init(&session, GNUTLS_CLIENT);

    gnutls_server_name_set(session, GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, "example.com");

    ret = gnutls_handshake(session);
    if (ret < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Handshake failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Connected successfully\n");

    gnutls_bye(session, GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR);

    gnutls_deinit(session);
    gnutls_certificate_free_credentials(credentials);

    gnutls_global_deinit();

    return 0;
}
```

Make sure to have the server's certificate ("server.crt") and private key ("server.key") in the same directory as this program. This is a basic example and may require additional error handling and configuration for a real-world scenario.

To compile the program, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -o tls_client tls_client.c -lgnutls
```

To run the compiled program:
```bash
./tls_client
```
