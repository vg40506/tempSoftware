Use Case: Secure network communication using GnuTLS
Code details and examples:
GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing SSL, TLS, and DTLS protocols. It provides encryption, authentication, and cryptographic functions for secure network communication.

To use GnuTLS in a C program, you need to include the necessary header files and link against the GnuTLS library. Here is a simple example of using GnuTLS to create a secure connection with a server:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

int main() {
    gnutls_global_init();
    
    // Initialize the session
    gnutls_session_t session;
    gnutls_init(&session, GNUTLS_CLIENT);
    
    // Set the server hostname
    gnutls_server_name_set(session, GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, "example.com", strlen("example.com"));
    
    // Perform the handshake
    gnutls_handshake(session);
    
    // Secure communication goes here
    
    // Close the session
    gnutls_bye(session, GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR);
    gnutls_deinit(session);
    
    gnutls_global_deinit();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you would need error handling, certificate verification, etc.

To compile and run the program, you can use the following commands:

```shell
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lgnutls
./my_program
```

This will compile the program and run it, establishing a secure connection with the server "example.com".
