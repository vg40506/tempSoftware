Use Case: Downloading a file from a URL

Code details and examples:
To download a file from a URL using curl, you can simply use the following command:

```bash
curl -O [URL]
```

For example, to download a file named example.txt from a website:

```bash
curl -O https://www.example.com/example.txt
```

This will download the file and save it in the current directory with the same name as the file on the server.
