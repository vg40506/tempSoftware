Use Case: DeepLabCut is a toolbox for markerless pose estimation of animals or objects in videos. It is widely used in neuroscience and behavioral research.

Code details and examples:
- You need to create a project with labeled frames and specify the body parts to track.
- Use the provided config.yaml file to set up the parameters for training.
- Run the training using the following command:
```
deeplabcut train-network <your-project-path> -c config.yaml
```
- Once the model is trained, you can analyze new videos using the following command:
```
deeplabcut analyze-videos <your-project-path>/config.yaml <video-file>
```
- Finally, you can visualize the results using the following command:
```
deeplabcut plot-trajectories <your-project-path>/config.yaml <video-file>
```

Sample input files:
- config.yaml: Contains parameters for training such as body parts and network architecture.
- labeled frames: Contains images with labeled body parts for training.
- video file: Contains the video that you want to analyze.

Note: DeepLabCut requires Python to run, and it is recommended to install it through Anaconda.
