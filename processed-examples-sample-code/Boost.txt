Use Case: Boost is a collection of peer-reviewed C++ libraries that are widely used in the industry.
Code details and examples: 
Boost is a collection of C++ libraries that can be used for various purposes such as utilities, data structures, algorithms, and more. Here are some examples of how you can use Boost libraries:

1. Boost Filesystem:
Boost Filesystem library provides facilities for performing operations on files and directories. Here is a sample code snippet using Boost Filesystem to list files in a directory:

```cpp
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>

namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

int main() {
    fs::path directory_path("/path/to/directory");

    for (const auto& entry : fs::directory_iterator(directory_path)) {
        std::cout << entry.path().filename() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

2. Boost Regex:
Boost Regex library provides support for regular expressions in C++. Here is an example of using Boost Regex to search for a pattern in a string:

```cpp
#include <boost/regex.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string text = "Hello, World!";
    boost::regex pattern("W[a-z]+d");

    if (boost::regex_search(text, pattern)) {
        std::cout << "Pattern found in the text." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Pattern not found in the text." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

These are just a couple of examples, and Boost provides many more libraries for different purposes like date/time manipulation, serialization, math, and more.

To compile the above examples using g++, you can use the following command:
```
g++ example.cpp -o example -lboost_filesystem -lboost_regex
```

Replace `example.cpp` with the filename of the example code you want to compile.
