Use Case: Profiling parallel applications using Score-P

Code details and examples:
Score-P is a performance measurement infrastructure for parallel programs. It provides support for instrumentation, measurement, and analysis of HPC applications. Below is an example of how to use Score-P to profile a parallel application.

Sample input file (hello_world.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "omp.h"

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        printf("Hello World from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Compilation:
```
scorep --mpp=mpi --compiler mpicc mpicc -fopenmp -o hello_world hello_world.c
```

Execution:
```
scorep --mpp=mpi mpirun -np 4 ./hello_world
```

This will generate measurement data that can be analyzed using tools provided by Score-P.
