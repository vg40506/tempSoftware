Use Case: libfabric is a high-performance networking API that is used to build efficient, portable, and scalable high-performance applications. 

Code details and examples:
Sample input files:
- input.txt: A simple text file with some sample content.

Code:
1. Writing a simple program using libfabric to read a file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <rdma/fabric.h>

#define FILENAME "input.txt"

int main() {
    struct fi_info *hints, *info;
    fi_info(FT_UNSPEC, "psm2", hints, &info);
    
    FILE* file = fopen(FILENAME, "r");
    
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    char buffer[256];
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    
    fclose(file);
    
    fi_freeinfo(info);
    
    return 0;
}
```

2. Compiling and running the program:

```bash
gcc -o read_file read_file.c -lpsm2 -lfi
./read_file
```

This is a simple example of how libfabric can be used in a program to read a file. The program opens a file called "input.txt" and prints its contents to the console.
