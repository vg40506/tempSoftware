Use Case: RAPIDS is a suite of open-source software libraries and APIs built on CUDA for executing end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs.

Code details and examples:
1. cuDF - DataFrame manipulation library:
Sample input file format: CSV file
```python
import cudf

# Load CSV file into a cuDF DataFrame
df = cudf.read_csv('sample.csv')

# Perform operations on the DataFrame
```

2. cuGraph - Graph analytics library:
Sample input file format: Edge list file
```python
import cugraph

# Load edge list file into a cuGraph Graph
G = cugraph.Graph()
G.from_cudf_edgelist(edge_list_df)

# Run graph algorithms
```

3. cuML - Machine learning library:
Sample input file format: CSV file for training data
```python
import cuml

# Load CSV file into a cuDF DataFrame
train_data = cudf.read_csv('train.csv')

# Split data into X (features) and y (target)
X = train_data.drop(columns=['target'])
y = train_data['target']

# Train a machine learning model
model = cuml.LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
```

To run these examples, you need to have RAPIDS installed and configured correctly on a system with compatible GPUs and CUDA drivers.
