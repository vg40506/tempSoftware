Use Case: SPAdes (St. Petersburg genome assembler) is a genome assembly tool designed for single-cell and multi-cell bacterial genome projects.

Code details and examples:
- Example command to run SPAdes with paired-end Illumina reads:
```
spades.py -1 path/to/reads_R1.fastq -2 path/to/reads_R2.fastq -o output_directory
```

- Example command to run SPAdes with single-end Illumina reads:
```
spades.py --s1 path/to/reads.fastq -o output_directory
```

- Sample input files for running SPAdes: 
  - `reads_R1.fastq`: File containing forward paired-end Illumina reads
  - `reads_R2.fastq`: File containing reverse paired-end Illumina reads
  - `reads.fastq`: File containing single-end Illumina reads

- Output will be the assembled contigs in the specified output directory.

For more details and options, you can refer to the SPAdes documentation.
