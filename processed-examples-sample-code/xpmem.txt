Use Case: Inter-node shared memory communication

Code details and examples:
XPMEM is a Linux kernel module that enables shared memory communication between processes on different nodes. It is often used in HPC environments for efficient inter-node communication. Below is an example of how to set up and use XPMEM:

1. Load the xpmem kernel module:
```bash
sudo modprobe xpmem
```

2. To use XPMEM, you will need to allocate memory using the xpmem driver. Here is an example code snippet using C:

```c
#include <xpmem.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int size = 1024; // size of shared memory
    int flags = 0; // permission flags
    uintptr_t addr;
    
    struct xpmem_addr xpmem_addr;

    int xpmem_fd = xpmem_make(size, flags, &xpmem_addr);
    if (xpmem_fd < 0) {
        perror("xpmem_make");
        return -1;
    }

    addr = xpmem_addr.apid;
    
    printf("Shared memory address: %p\n", (void *)addr);
    
    // Use the shared memory

    xpmem_release(xpmem_fd);

    return 0;
}
```

3. Compile the code and run it. Make sure to link against the xpmem library.

```bash
gcc -o xpmem_example xpmem_example.c -lxpmem
./xpmem_example
```
