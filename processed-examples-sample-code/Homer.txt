Use Case: Homer is a suite of tools for motif discovery and next-gen sequencing analysis. 
Code details and examples:
1. Find motifs in a given input sequence file:
```bash
findMotifs.pl input_sequence.fa fasta output_directory -len 8 -rna
```
2. Merge peaks from multiple peak files:
```bash
mergePeaks file1.txt file2.txt > merged_peaks.txt
```
3. Annotate peaks with gene annotations:
```bash
annotatePeaks.pl merged_peaks.txt genome_version > annotated_peaks.txt
```
