Use Case: Securely transfer large files between HPC systems.

Code details and examples: 
bbftp is a tool that enables secure and efficient file transfer between HPC systems. Below is an example of how to use bbftp to transfer a file from a source to a destination:

1. Prepare a configuration file (`bbftprc`) with the following content:
```plaintext
[bbftp]
srcaddr = source_address
srcport = 10000
srcrlg = source_path
[bbftp]
dstaddr = destination_address
dstport = 10000
```

2. Start the bbftpd server on the destination machine:
```bash
bbftpd
```

3. Transfer the file using bbftp from the source machine:
```bash
bbftp -s -m -e bbftprc
```

This will transfer the file specified in the source path to the destination address.
