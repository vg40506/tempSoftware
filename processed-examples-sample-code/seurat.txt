Use Case: Seurat is a popular R package for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

Code details and examples:
Seurat requires an R environment to run. Here are some basic commands to get started with Seurat:

Install Seurat package:
```R
install.packages("Seurat")
```

Load Seurat library:
```R
library(Seurat)
```

Create a Seurat object from a matrix of gene expression counts:
```R
# Load example dataset
data("pbmc_small")

# Create a Seurat object
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc_small$RNA, project = "pbmc_small")
```

Perform basic QC and normalization:
```R
pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc)
pbmc <- FindVariableFeatures(pbmc)
pbmc <- ScaleData(pbmc)
```

Cluster cells and visualize:
```R
pbmc <- RunPCA(pbmc, verbose = FALSE)
pbmc <- FindNeighbors(pbmc, dims = 1:10)
pbmc <- FindClusters(pbmc, resolution = 0.6)
pbmc <- RunUMAP(pbmc, dims = 1:10)
DimPlot(pbmc, label = TRUE)
```

Please note that the above commands are just examples and may need to be adjusted based on your specific dataset and analysis goals.
