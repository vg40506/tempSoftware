Use Case: Benchmarking MPI performance
Code details and examples:
mpiBench is a benchmarking tool that helps evaluate the performance of Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementations on high-performance computing systems. It provides multiple test cases to measure the communication and computation performance of MPI.

To run mpiBench, you can follow these steps:

1. Download and install mpiBench on your system.
2. Prepare the input files or use the provided sample input files.
3. Run the mpiBench executable with the desired options.

Sample input files may vary depending on the specific benchmark being executed. Here is an example of running mpiBench with a simple ping-pong test:

```
$ mpiBench pingpong -n 1000
```

This command will run the ping-pong test with 1000 iterations. The output will include performance metrics such as latency, bandwidth, and message rate.

Please refer to the documentation or the help menu of mpiBench for more details on available benchmarks and how to run them.
