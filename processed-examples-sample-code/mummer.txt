Use Case: Whole genome alignment with MUMmer

Code details and examples:
MUMmer is a system for rapidly aligning entire genomes, whether in complete or draft form. It can often find the best global alignment between two genomes very quickly; other alignments are also available. MUMmer can also align incomplete genomes; it is capable of handling the 100s or 1000s of contigs produced by current sequencing technologies.

To perform a whole genome alignment using MUMmer, you can use the 'nucmer' utility to align two DNA sequences and the 'dnadiff' utility to generate a summary report of the differences between the sequences.

1. Align two DNA sequences using nucmer:

Create two fasta files containing the sequences to be aligned, for example:
- sequence1.fasta
- sequence2.fasta

```
nucmer sequence1.fasta sequence2.fasta -p output_prefix
```

This will generate multiple output files with the specified output prefix.

2. Generate a summary report of the differences using dnadiff:

```
dnadiff output_prefix.delta
```

This will generate a report detailing the differences between the two sequences.

Please refer to the MUMmer documentation for more options and details on using the tool.
