Use Case: Performance analysis of HPC applications with TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities)

Code Details and Examples:
TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) is a widely used performance analysis tool for parallel and high-performance computing applications. TAU supports various profiling methods, performance instrumentation, and performance visualization.

1. Example of instrumenting and profiling a simple C application using TAU:
Sample C code (sample.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the code with TAU compiler wrapper (tau_cc):
```
tau_cc sample.c -o sample_tau
```

Run the instrumented binary with TAU's profiling options:
```
mpiexec -n 4 ./sample_tau
```

2. Example of generating a TAU profile and viewing it with TAU's command-line utilities:
Generate a TAU profile:
```
pprof
```

View the TAU profile:
```
paraprof
```

These are just basic examples to demonstrate the usage of TAU for performance analysis of HPC applications. TAU provides a wide range of features and options for in-depth performance evaluation of parallel programs.
