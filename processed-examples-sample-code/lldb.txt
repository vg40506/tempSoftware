lldb (Low Level Debugger) is a debugger similar to gdb, specifically built for debugging programs written in C, C++, and Objective-C languages.

Use Case: Debugging a C program
Code details and examples:
Sample C program (example.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 20;
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the program with debugging information:
```bash
clang -g example.c -o example
```

Run lldb debugger on the compiled program:
```bash
lldb example
```

Within lldb prompt, you can set breakpoints, examine variables, and control program execution. For example, setting a breakpoint at a certain line:
```
(lldb) breakpoint set --file example.c --line 7
```

Run the program with additional arguments:
```
(lldb) run arg1 arg2
```
