Use Case: lifelines is a Python library for survival analysis and reliability analysis. It offers tools for estimating hazard rates, survival functions, and more.

Code details and examples:
```python
# Sample input file (CSV format):
# time, event
# 5, 1
# 10, 0
# 15, 1
# 20, 1
# 25, 0

from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter
import pandas as pd

# Load data from CSV
data = pd.read_csv('survival_data.csv')

# Fit the Kaplan-Meier estimator
kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()
kmf.fit(data['time'], event_observed=data['event'])

# Plot the Kaplan-Meier survival curve
kmf.plot()
```

Command to run the code (after installing lifelines):
```bash
python script.py
```

This example demonstrates how to use lifelines to perform survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
