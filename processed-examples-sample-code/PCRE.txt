Use Case: PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)

Code details and examples:
PCRE is a library that implements Perl-compatible regular expressions. It provides a way for pattern matching with regular expressions similar to those used in Perl programming language.

For example, let's say you have a file named "example.txt" with the following content:
```
Hello, World!
This is a test file.
```

Here is a sample code snippet in C using PCRE to search for a specific pattern in the file:

```c
#include <pcre.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    pcre *re;
    const char *pattern = "test";
    const char *error;
    int erroffset;
    int ovector[30];
    int rc;

    re = pcre_compile(pattern, 0, &error, &erroffset, NULL);
    if (re == NULL) {
        printf("PCRE compilation failed at offset %d: %s\n", erroffset, error);
        return 1;
    }

    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    char line[256];
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {
        rc = pcre_exec(re, NULL, line, strlen(line), 0, 0, ovector, 30);
        if (rc >= 0) {
            printf("Pattern found in: %s", line);
        }
    }

    pcre_free(re);
    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code using PCRE library (assuming the file is named "example.c"):
```
gcc example.c -lpcre -o example
```

To run the compiled executable:
```
./example
```

This will search for the pattern "test" in the file "example.txt" and print the lines where the pattern is found.
