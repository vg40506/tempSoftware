Use Case: Visualizing training results in PyTorch using TensorboardX

Code details and examples:
```python
import torch
import torchvision
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter

# Create a SummaryWriter for logging
writer = SummaryWriter()

# Add scalar data to Tensorboard
for i in range(10):
    writer.add_scalar('data/scalar', i*0.1, i)

# Add image data to Tensorboard
dummy_img = torch.rand(3, 64, 64)
writer.add_image('Image', dummy_img, 1)

# Add model graph to Tensorboard
model = torchvision.models.resnet18()
data = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)
writer.add_graph(model, data)

# Close the writer
writer.close()
```

To run the code snippet above, you can save it in a Python file (e.g., `tensorboard_example.py`) and execute it in your terminal:

```
python tensorboard_example.py
```
