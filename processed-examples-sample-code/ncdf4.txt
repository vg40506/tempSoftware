Use Case: NetCDF file manipulation  
Code details and examples:  

NetCDF files are commonly used in scientific computing for storing multidimensional data. The `ncdf4` package in R allows for reading and writing NetCDF files. Here is an example of how to read a NetCDF file using `ncdf4`:

```R
library(ncdf4)

# Open the NetCDF file
ncfile <- nc_open("example.nc")

# Get information about the NetCDF file
print(ncfile)

# Read a variable from the NetCDF file
data <- ncvar_get(ncfile, "variable_name")

# Close the NetCDF file
nc_close(ncfile)
```

In the above code snippet, replace `"example.nc"` with the path to your NetCDF file and `"variable_name"` with the name of the variable you want to read.
