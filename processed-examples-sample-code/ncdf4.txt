Use Case: NetCDF file manipulation in R using ncdf4 package

Code details and examples:
```R
# Load the ncdf4 library
library(ncdf4)

# Open a NetCDF file for reading
ncfile <- nc_open("example.nc")

# Read a variable from the NetCDF file
data <- ncvar_get(ncfile, "variable_name")

# Close the NetCDF file
nc_close(ncfile)
```

Command to run in R console:
```R
source("script.R")
```

Note: Replace "example.nc" with the actual path to your NetCDF file and "variable_name" with the name of the variable you want to read.
