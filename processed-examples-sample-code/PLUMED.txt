Use Case: PLUMED is an open-source library for free energy calculations in molecular systems.

Code details and examples:
PLUMED requires a configuration file (usually named plumed.dat) to specify the collective variables and biases to be used in the simulation.

Sample plumed.dat file:
```
# Compute the distance between atoms 1 and 2
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2

# Harmonic bias potential along the distance
kappa: KAPPA ...
BIASVALUE=5.0

# Output the distance and bias energy
PRINT ARG=d,kappa FILE=COLVAR
```

To run a simulation with PLUMED, you would typically launch your MD simulation code (e.g., GROMACS, LAMMPS) with PLUMED as a plugin. The command to run the simulation would depend on the specific simulation code you are using.

It's important to note that PLUMED is typically used in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulation software, so the exact command to run would vary depending on the simulation package being employed.
