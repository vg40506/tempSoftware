Use Case: CuPy is a GPU array library that can accelerate NumPy-compatible libraries with CUDA. 

Code details and examples:
CuPy can be used similar to NumPy but running on GPU. Here is an example of using CuPy to perform matrix multiplication:

```python
import cupy as cp

# Create random matrices
A = cp.random.randn(3, 3)
B = cp.random.randn(3, 3)

# Perform matrix multiplication
C = cp.dot(A, B)

print(C)
```

To run the code, make sure you have CuPy and CUDA installed and configured properly, then you can simply run the script using Python.

Command to run: ```python my_script.py```
