Use Case: Convex hull computation
Code details and examples:
Qhull is a software library for computing the convex hull of a set of points in N-dimensional space. It can be used for a variety of applications, including computational geometry, graphics, and machine learning.

Sample input file (points.txt):
```
3
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3
```

Code snippet to run Qhull (assuming points.txt contains the input points):
```
$ qhull < points.txt
```

This will output the convex hull of the given points.
