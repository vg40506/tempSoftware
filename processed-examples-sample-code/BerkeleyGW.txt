Use Case: BerkeleyGW is a set of computer codes that calculates the quasiparticle properties and the optical responses of a large variety of materials from bulk periodic crystals to nanostructures. 

Code details and examples:
1. To calculate the electronic band structures using BerkeleyGW, you can use the following input file (example.in):

```
BANDS
    ng0    ng1    ng2    divk   ecut   nempty
    8      8      8      6      7.0    10
END
```

2. Run the calculation using the following command:

```
bgw.x -npools 1 -nimage 1 -input example.in > example.out
```

3. Check the output file (example.out) for the results of the electronic band structure calculation.
