I see you mentioned QEMU, which is an open-source machine emulator and virtualizer. It allows users to run operating systems and programs for one machine on a different machine. Below are some details and examples for using QEMU:

Use Case: Emulate an ARM-based system using QEMU
Code details and examples:
1. Create a sample ARM assembly program (e.g., `hello.s`):
```arm
    .global _start
    _start:
        mov     r7, #4
        ldr     r0, =msg
        mov     r2, #11
        svc     0

        mov     r7, #1
        mov     r0, #0
        svc     0

    msg:
        .ascii  "Hello World\n"
```

2. Assemble the program using the ARM GCC toolchain:
```bash
arm-linux-gnueabihf-as -o hello.o hello.s
arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld -o hello hello.o
```

3. Run the ARM binary in QEMU:
```bash
qemu-arm ./hello
```

This is a simple example of using QEMU to emulate an ARM-based system and run an assembly program on it.
