Use Case: Emulate hardware and virtual machines with QEMU

Code details and examples:
QEMU is a free and open-source emulator that can emulate various architectures and hardware. It's commonly used for testing software on different platforms or creating virtual machines.

Sample command to run QEMU:
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -hda disk_image.img -cdrom installer.iso -boot d
```

In this example:
- `qemu-system-x86_64` is the command to start QEMU for x86 architecture.
- `-hda disk_image.img` specifies the disk image to be used as the virtual hard drive.
- `-cdrom installer.iso` specifies the ISO image to be used as the virtual CD-ROM.
- `-boot d` specifies that the virtual machine should boot from the CD-ROM.

Please note that the actual command and flags may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.
