Use Case: Climate Data Operators (CDO) is a collection of command-line operators to manipulate and analyze climate and NWP model data. 

Code details and examples:
CDO can be used to perform various operations on NetCDF files such as merging, splitting, remapping, calculating statistics, etc.

Example command to merge two NetCDF files:
```bash
cdo mergetime file1.nc file2.nc merged.nc
```

Example command to calculate the mean of a variable over time:
```bash
cdo timmean input.nc output.nc
```

CDO has a wide range of operators and options for tasks related to climate data processing. The specific usage and options can vary based on the operation being performed.
