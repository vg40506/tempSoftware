Use Case: Natural Language Processing with spaCy
Code details and examples:
spaCy is a popular natural language processing library in Python that provides efficient NLP functionalities. It can be used for tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more.

Sample code for tokenization using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

# Load English tokenizer, tagger, parser, NER and word vectors
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process a text
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")

# Print token text and token index
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.i)
```

Sample code for named entity recognition using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

# Load English NER model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process a text
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")

# Print named entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

To install spaCy, you can use pip:
