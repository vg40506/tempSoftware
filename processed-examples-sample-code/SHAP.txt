Use Case: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a popular Python library for interpreting machine learning models.

Code details and examples:
```python
import shap
import numpy as np

# Load a model (example using a dummy model)
model = lambda x: np.sum(x, axis=1) + np.random.randn(x.shape[0])
data = np.random.randn(100, 5)

# Create an explainer object
explainer = shap.Explainer(model, data)

# Calculate SHAP values for a specific instance
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(data[0])

print(shap_values)
```

Note: This is a basic example of using SHAP to calculate SHAP values for a dummy model and a sample input data.
It is important to replace the dummy model with your own trained model and the data with your dataset.

To run the above code, simply execute it in a Python environment with SHAP installed.
