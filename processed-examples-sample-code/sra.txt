Use Case: Downloading data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)
Code details and examples:
To download data from the SRA, you can use the SRA Toolkit which provides the `fastq-dump` command for this purpose.

1. First, you need to have the SRA Toolkit installed. If you do not have it installed, you can download it from the NCBI website: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software

2. Once you have the SRA Toolkit installed, you can use the following command to download data from SRA. Replace `SRA_RUN_ID` with the actual SRA run accession number.

```bash
fastq-dump SRA_RUN_ID
```

This command will download the data in fastq format from the specified SRA run accession.

3. For example, if you want to download data from SRA run accession SRR4052018, you can use the following command:

```bash
fastq-dump SRR4052018
```

This will download the data in fastq format from the specified SRA run accession SRR4052018.
