Use Case: SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, and graphics hardware. It is often used for developing games, multimedia applications, and emulators.

Code details and examples:
```c
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

    SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("SDL2 Sample", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, 640, 480, 0);
    SDL_Renderer* renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);

    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 255, 0, 0, 255);

    SDL_RenderClear(renderer);

    SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);

    SDL_Delay(3000);

    SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);

    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the above code (assuming the file is named `sdl_sample.c`):
```
gcc sdl_sample.c -o sdl_sample `sdl2-config --cflags --libs`
```

To run the compiled executable:
```
./sdl_sample
```
