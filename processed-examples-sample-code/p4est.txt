Use Case: p4est is a library for dynamic, adaptive and parallel refinement on forests of octrees. It enables the construction and manipulation of forests of octrees and can be used in a variety of scientific computing applications.

Code details and examples:
1. Creating an octree:
```c
// Initialize p4est library
p4est_init(NULL, SC_LP);

// Create an octree
int min_level = 0;
int max_level = 4;
size_t dim = 2; // Dimension of the octree (2D or 3D)
p4est_connectivity_t *conn = p4est_connectivity_new_unitsquare(); // For 2D
p4est_t *p4est = p4est_new(conn, min_level, max_level, dim);

// Refine the octree
int num_refinements = 3;
p4est_refine(p4est, num_refinements);

// Destroy the octree
p4est_destroy(p4est);
p4est_connectivity_destroy(conn);

// Finalize p4est library
p4est_finalize();
```

2. Sample input file for the octree (input.txt):
```
2
3
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
1 1 1
2 1 1
1 2 1
1 1 2
```

3. Command to compile and run the code (Assuming the code is saved in code.c):
```
gcc code.c -o octree_example -lp4est -lsc
./octree_example
```
