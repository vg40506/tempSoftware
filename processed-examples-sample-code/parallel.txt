Use Case: Task parallelism
Code details and examples: 
```
# Sample input file
echo "Task 1" > task1.txt
echo "Task 2" > task2.txt
echo "Task 3" > task3.txt

# Running tasks in parallel using parallel
cat task*.txt | parallel
```

Use Case: Processing multiple files in parallel
Code details and examples:
```
# Sample input files
echo "File 1 contents" > file1.txt
echo "File 2 contents" > file2.txt
echo "File 3 contents" > file3.txt

# Running a command on multiple files using parallel
ls *.txt | parallel 'wc -l {}'
```

Use Case: Running multiple commands in parallel
Code details and examples:
```
# Running multiple commands in parallel
parallel ::: "echo Hello" "echo World"
```

Note: The above examples are just simple cases to demonstrate the usage of the `parallel` command. The actual usage can vary based on the specific use case.
