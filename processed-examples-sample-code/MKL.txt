Use Case: Linear algebra library for high-performance computing.

Code details and examples: 
MKL (Math Kernel Library) is a mathematical library that provides optimized routines for linear algebra, fast Fourier transforms, vector math, and more. It is commonly used in high-performance computing applications to accelerate mathematical computations.

Example of using MKL to perform matrix multiplication in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mkl.h>

int main() {
    double A[2][2] = {{1.0, 2.0}, {3.0, 4.0}};
    double B[2][2] = {{4.0, 3.0}, {2.0, 1.0}};
    double C[2][2];

    cblas_dgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans, 2, 2, 2, 1.0, *A, 2, *B, 2, 0.0, *C, 2);

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            printf("%f ", C[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code using MKL in C, use the following command:

```
icc -o matmul matmul.c -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lpthread -lm -ldl
```

This command assumes you have Intel's C compiler (icc) and MKL installed on your system.
