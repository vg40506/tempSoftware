Use Case: Bismark is a tool for the alignment of bisulfite-converted sequencing reads, and for DNA methylation analysis.
Code details and examples:
```bash
bismark --genome hg19 sample_R1.fastq
```
In this example, "bismark" aligns sequencing reads from the file "sample_R1.fastq" to the human genome (hg19).

Note: The actual command may vary depending on the specific requirements of the analysis.
