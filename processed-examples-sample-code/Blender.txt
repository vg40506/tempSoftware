Blender is a 3D creation suite that supports the entire 3D pipeline - modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking. It is often used for creating animations, visual effects, video games, and more.

Use Case: Create a basic 3D model using Blender
Code details and examples:
```python
import bpy

# Clear existing objects
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a cube
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, enter_editmode=False, align='WORLD', location=(0, 0, 0))

# Save the scene
bpy.ops.wm.save_as_mainfile(filepath="basic_cube.blend")
```

To run the script above, you can save it as a Python file (e.g., `create_cube.py`) and then run it in Blender by opening Blender from the command line and passing the script file as an argument:
```
blender -b -P create_cube.py
```

This will create a basic 3D model of a cube and save it as `basic_cube.blend`.
