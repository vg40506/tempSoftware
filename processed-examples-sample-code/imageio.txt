Use Case: Image reading and writing library.

Code details and examples:
Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image file formats. Here is an example of how to read an image file using imageio:

```python
import imageio

# Read an image file
image = imageio.imread('image.jpg')

# Display the image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

To write an image file:
```python
import imageio

# Create an image array
image_array = np.random.randint(0, 255, (200, 200, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Write the image to a file
imageio.imsave('random_image.png', image_array)
```

In the code examples above, 'image.jpg' is the input image file to be read and 'random_image.png' is the output image file to be saved.

Make sure to have `imageio` and `matplotlib` (for displaying the image) installed in your Python environment.
