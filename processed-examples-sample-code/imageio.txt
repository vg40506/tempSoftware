Use Case: Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image data. It supports formats such as PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and many more.

Code details and examples:
```python
import imageio

# Reading an image
image = imageio.imread('sample_image.png')

# Displaying image shape
print(image.shape)

# Writing an image
imageio.imwrite('output_image.jpg', image)
```

Command: N/A - Since imageio is a Python library, you can run the Python script directly using a Python interpreter.
