Use Case: File compression with gzip

Code details and examples:
```
# Example input file
# Create a sample file
echo "Hello, this is a sample text file" > sample.txt

# Compress the file using gzip
gzip sample.txt

# This will create a compressed file named sample.txt.gz
```

To decompress the file:
```
# Decompress the file using gzip
gzip -d sample.txt.gz

# This will decompress the file back to its original state
```
