Use Case: Retrieving information about installed libraries.

Code details and examples:
  
`pkg-config` is a helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries. It helps to retrieve information about the compiler flags needed to link a library.

To get the compiler flags for a specific package, you can use the following command:

```bash
pkg-config --cflags --libs <package-name>
```

For example, to get information about the `gtk+-3.0` package, you can run:

```bash
pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0
```

This will output the compiler flags needed to compile and link a program with the `gtk+-3.0` library.

Note: The above command may vary based on the package you are querying.
