Use Case: dakota is a flexible, extensible, and multiplatform software framework for design exploration and optimization. It offers parameter studies, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis capabilities.

Code details and examples:
For running dakota, you would typically provide a configuration file in which you specify the method, response functions, variables, and other details related to the study. Here is an example of a dakota input file named `dakota.in`:

```plaintext
environment
  tabular_data
    tabular_data_file = 'results.dat'

method
  analysis_driver = 'python dakota_script.py'
  parameters_file = 'parameters.in'
  interface
    fork
  asynchronous
    evaluation_concurrency = 2

model
  single

responses
  objective_functions = 1
  no_gradients
```

In this example, `dakota_script.py` is a Python script that reads the input parameters from `parameters.in` and writes the results to `results.dat`.

To run dakota with this input file, you would use the command:

```
dakota -i dakota.in
```

This command tells dakota to read the input file `dakota.in` and execute the study according to the specified configurations.

Please note that the input file format and details may vary depending on the specific study being conducted.
