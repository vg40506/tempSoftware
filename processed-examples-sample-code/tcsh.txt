Use Case: tcsh (Tenex C Shell) is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C shell (csh). It provides command-line editing, history substitution, and a variety of interactive features.

Code details and examples:
- To start a tcsh session, simply type `tcsh` in the terminal:
```
tcsh
```

- To run a script in tcsh, create a script file (e.g., `script.tcsh`) with your commands and then run it as follows:
```
tcsh script.tcsh
```

- You can also execute a single command using the `-c` option:
```
tcsh -c "echo Hello, World!"
```

- Within a tcsh script, you can use variables and conditionals. For example:
```tcsh
#!/bin/tcsh

set name = "Alice"

if ($name == "Alice") then
    echo "Hello, $name!"
else
    echo "Hello, Stranger!"
endif
```

- Additionally, tcsh supports standard shell features such as piping and redirection:
```
ls | grep txt > file_list.txt
```

Please note that tcsh commands and syntax may vary slightly from other shells like bash.
