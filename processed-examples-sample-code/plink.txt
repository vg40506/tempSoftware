Use Case: PLINK is a widely used software for performing genetic association analysis in large-scale genomic datasets.

Code details and examples:
1. Checking the version of PLINK:
```bash
plink --version
```

2. Performing a basic association analysis:
```bash
plink --file mydata --assoc
```
- In this example, "mydata" is the prefix of the PLINK data files (e.g., mydata.bed, mydata.bim, mydata.fam).

3. Generating a genome-wide identity by state (IBS) matrix:
```bash
plink --bfile mydata --make-rel
```

4. Running a principal component analysis (PCA):
```bash
plink --bfile mydata --pca
```

5. Conducting a case-control association study:
```bash
plink --bfile mydata --logistic
```

Note: The input files for PLINK have specific formats (e.g., .bed, .bim, .fam for binary PED format). It is important to ensure the input files are correctly formatted before running the commands.
