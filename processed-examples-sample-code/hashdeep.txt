Use Case: hashdeep is a cross-platform set of tools to compute hashes using multiple algorithms on files and directories.

Code details and examples:
1. Create an example file for hashing:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!" > example.txt
   ```

2. Compute hashes of the example file using hashdeep:
   ```bash
   hashdeep -c sha256 example.txt
   ```

3. Compute hashes of files in a directory:
   ```bash
   hashdeep -r -c sha256 /path/to/directory
   ```

4. Verify hashes using a hash file:
   ```bash
   hashdeep -k hashfile.txt -c sha256 -a example.txt
   ```
