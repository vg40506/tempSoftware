Use Case: Molecular dynamics simulation 
Code details and examples: 
NAMD (NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics) is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. Here is an example of running a NAMD simulation with a provided configuration file:

Input files: 
1. Configuration file (config.namd)
2. Protein structure file (protein.pdb)

config.namd:
```bash
# NAMD configuration file
structure protein.pdb
outputName output
```

To run NAMD: 
```bash
namd2 +p4 config.namd
```

In this example, "+p4" specifies that the simulation will be run using 4 processors. You can adjust the number of processors as needed for your system.
