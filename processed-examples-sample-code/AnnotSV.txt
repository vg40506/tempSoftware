Use Case: AnnotSV is a software tool for annotating and prioritizing structural variants (SVs) detected from genome sequencing data.

Code details and examples:
AnnotSV takes a VCF file containing SVs as input. Below is an example command to run AnnotSV on a VCF file:

```
AnnotSV -SVinputFile input.vcf -outputFile output.txt
```

In this command:
- `-SVinputFile`: specifies the input VCF file containing SVs.
- `-outputFile`: specifies the output file where the annotated and prioritized SVs will be saved.

AnnotSV provides detailed annotations for each SV, including information about genes, functional impact, allele frequency, and more.

Note: AnnotSV also requires a reference genome file for annotation. Make sure to have the reference genome available when running the tool.
