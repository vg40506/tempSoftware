Use Case: Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries on top of this format.

Code details and examples: 
Apache Arrow supports various programming languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc. Below is a simple example using Python:

```python
import pyarrow as pa

# Create a simple Arrow array
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array = pa.array(data)

# Write and read back Arrow array to a file
with pa.OSFile('data.arrow', 'wb') as f:
    writer = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter(f, array.type)
    batch = pa.RecordBatch.from_arrays([array], ['numbers'])
    writer.write_batch(batch)
    
with pa.OSFile('data.arrow', 'rb') as f:
    reader = pa.open_file(f)
    print(reader.read_pandas())
```

To run the above code, save it in a Python file (e.g., `arrow_example.py`) and execute it using a Python interpreter.

Command to run:
```bash
python arrow_example.py
```
