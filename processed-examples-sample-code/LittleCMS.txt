Use Case: Color management and image processing library

Code details and examples:

LittleCMS (LCMS) is an open-source color management engine providing accurate color management across various devices and platforms. Below is an example of how you can use LittleCMS to transform a color profile of an image using sample input files.

Input:
- Original image with Adobe RGB color profile: original_image.jpg
- Destination color profile to convert to: sRGB_color_profile.icc

Code:
```bash
# Transforming the color profile of an image using LittleCMS
convert original_image.jpg -profile sRGB_color_profile.icc converted_image.jpg
```

In the above code, the "convert" command is used with the "-profile" option to apply the destination color profile to the original image using LittleCMS.
