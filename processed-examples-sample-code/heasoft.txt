Use Case: High Energy Astrophysics Software (HEASoft)
Code details and examples:
HEASoft is a software package commonly used in high energy astrophysics for the analysis of data from various telescopes such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. Below is an example of running the tool `xspec` to fit a spectral model to a sample X-ray spectrum file.

Sample input file (`sample_spectrum.pha`):
```
XSPEC 12.11.0
statistic chi
data 1:1 sample_spectrum.pha
response 1 arf.rmf
background 1 sample_spectrum_bkg.pha
ignore 1: **-0.5 7.0-**
model powerlaw
```

Code:
```
xspec - sample_spectrum.pha
```

This command will open the `xspec` tool and load the sample spectrum file `sample_spectrum.pha` for spectral fitting using a power-law model.
