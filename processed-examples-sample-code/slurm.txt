Use Case: Slurm is a workload manager designed for Linux clusters that provides a framework for job scheduling and management. It is widely used in HPC environments.

Code details and examples:
1. Submit a job:
```bash
sbatch myjob.sh
```

2. Check job status:
```bash
squeue -u myusername
```

3. Cancel a job:
```bash
scancel jobID
```

4. Create a configuration file (slurm.conf) to customize Slurm settings.

Sample input file (myjob.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=myjob
#SBATCH --output=output.txt
#SBATCH --error=error.txt

srun /path/to/myprogram
```

In this example, `myjob.sh` is a submission script for a job named `myjob` that runs `myprogram`.

Note: The actual contents of `myprogram` will vary based on the specific job requirements.
