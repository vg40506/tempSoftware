Use Case: Protein structure prediction using AlphaFold

Code details and examples:
AlphaFold is a deep-learning system developed by DeepMind for predicting protein structures. It takes protein sequences as input and predicts the 3D structure of the protein.

To run AlphaFold, you can use the Colab notebook provided by DeepMind:

1. Go to the AlphaFold GitHub repository: https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold
2. Follow the instructions in the README to open the Colab notebook.
3. Upload a text file with protein sequences (one sequence per line) to the Colab notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to predict the protein structures.

Here is a sample input file (sequences.txt) containing protein sequences:

```

```

Once you have uploaded the input file and run the notebook cells, AlphaFold will generate predicted protein structures.

Please note that running AlphaFold may require significant computational resources, and using the Colab notebook is recommended for ease of access.
