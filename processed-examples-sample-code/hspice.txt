Use Case: Electronic circuit simulation

Code details and examples: 
HSPICE is a popular circuit simulator used for analog and mixed-signal simulations. To run a simple transient analysis using HSPICE, you need to create a netlist file (.sp) that describes the circuit and simulation settings.

Sample input file (sample_circuit.sp):
```
* Simple RC circuit
V1 in 0 1.5
R1 in out 1k
C1 out 0 1u
.control
tran 0.1us 10us
.endc
.end
```

To run this simulation, you can use the following command:
```
hspice sample_circuit.sp
```

This will execute the HSPICE simulation on the provided netlist file and generate the simulation results.
