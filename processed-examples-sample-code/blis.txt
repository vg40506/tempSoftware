BLIS is an optimized BLAS library that stands for BLAS-Like Library Instantiation Software. 

Use Case: BLAS-like library instantiation software (BLIS)
Code details and examples:
Sample input files:
- Matrix A (2x3):
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
- Matrix B (3x2):
```
7 8
9 10
11 12
```

Code:
BLIS does not have a direct command-line interface for running operations. It is typically used as a library within other software packages like NumPy or SciPy in Python. Below is an example of performing matrix multiplication using NumPy with BLIS optimized operations.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy import matmul

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
B = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]])

result = matmul(A, B)
print(result)
```

In this example, BLIS optimizations will be used if NumPy is linked against BLIS during installation. The performance improvements will be seen in the matrix multiplication operation.
