Use Case: OpenSceneGraph is a powerful 3D graphics toolkit used for the development of high-performance graphics applications.

Code details and examples:
OpenSceneGraph provides a variety of examples in its installation directory that demonstrate different features and capabilities of the toolkit. One such example is the "osgviewer" application which can be used to view 3D models.

To run the "osgviewer" application with a sample input file, you can use the following command:
```
osgviewer cow.osg
```
In this example, "cow.osg" is a sample 3D model file that comes with OpenSceneGraph. The command will launch the viewer application and load the cow model for viewing.
