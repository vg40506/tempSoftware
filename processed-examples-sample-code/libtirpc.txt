Use Case: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library for network communication.
Code details and examples: 
libtirpc is a library that provides support for the transport-independent RPC (TI-RPC) protocol. It is commonly used in Unix-based systems for remote procedure call communication between processes over a network.

Sample input files: 
- No specific input files required for using the libtirpc library.

Code:
#include <rpc/rpc.h> 
// Include necessary header files for using the libtirpc library

// Sample code demonstrating the usage of libtirpc library
CLIENT *cl; 
cl = clnt_create("hostname", program_number, program_version, "nettype"); 
// Create a client handle
if (cl == NULL) { 
    clnt_pcreateerror("Error creating RPC client"); 
    exit(1); 
} 
// Use the client handle for making RPC calls
// Close the client handle when done
clnt_destroy(cl);

Command to run (if available): 
- No specific command to run as libtirpc is a library for use in programming and needs to be linked with the application using it.
