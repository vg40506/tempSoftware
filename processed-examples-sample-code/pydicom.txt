Use Case: DICOM Read and Write in Python

Code details and examples:
```python
import pydicom

# Reading a DICOM file
ds = pydicom.dcmread('sample.dcm')
print(ds)

# Accessing specific DICOM attributes
print('Patient Name:', ds.PatientName)
print('Patient ID:', ds.PatientID)

# Modifying and saving a DICOM file
ds.PatientName = 'John Doe'
ds.save_as('modified.dcm')
```

Please note that you will need to have a DICOM file (`.dcm`) for this example to work. You can replace `'sample.dcm'` with the path to your DICOM file.
