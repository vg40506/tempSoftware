Use Case: Programming Language

Code details and examples:
Tcl is a programming language commonly used for scripting and rapid prototyping. Here is a simple example of a Tcl script:

```tcl
# hello_world.tcl
puts "Hello, World!"
```

To run this Tcl script, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
tclsh hello_world.tcl
```

This will output:
```
Hello, World!
```

In Tcl scripts, the `.tcl` extension is commonly used, but it is not mandatory.
