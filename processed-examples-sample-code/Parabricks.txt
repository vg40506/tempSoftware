Use Case: Accelerating genomic analysis workflows using GPU-accelerated Parabricks software for variant calling, genome assembly, and more.

Code details and examples:
Parabricks provides a range of GPU-accelerated tools for bioinformatics analysis. Here is an example of using Parabricks for variant calling with sample input files.

1. Variant Calling:
Input files:
- Sample BAM file
- Reference genome FASTA file

Command to run Parabricks for variant calling:
```
pbrun germline --ref <reference_file.fasta> --bam <sample_file.bam> --output <output_directory> 
```

2. Genome Assembly:
Input files:
- Raw sequencing reads (in FASTQ format)

Command to run Parabricks for genome assembly:
```
pbrun assemble --input <reads_file.fastq> --output <output_directory>
```

Make sure to provide the correct input files and file paths according to your data.
