Use Case: Paraview is a popular visualization tool for scientific data analysis and visualization.

Code details and examples:
Paraview supports multiple file formats including VTK, PVD, XDMF, CSV, etc. Here is an example of loading a VTK file in Paraview:

Sample VTK file (example.vtk):
```vtk
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Example VTK file
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 4 float
0.0 0.0 0.0
1.0 0.0 0.0
1.0 1.0 0.0
0.0 1.0 0.0
```

To visualize this VTK file in Paraview:
1. Open Paraview.
2. Click on File -> Open.
3. Select example.vtk and click on OK.
4. The points will be loaded and displayed in the 3D view.

You can perform various visualizations, filters, and analyses on the loaded data using Paraview's GUI.

Alternatively, you can also use Paraview in batch mode for automation. Here is an example command to run Paraview in batch mode on a dataset:
```bash
paraview -- scripts/visualize.py
```
Ensure that `visualize.py` contains the necessary Python scripting commands to load data, apply filters, and save the visualization results.

Note: The actual commands may vary based on the specific requirements of your visualization task in Paraview.
