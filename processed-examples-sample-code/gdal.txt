Use Case: Geospatial data conversion and manipulation

Code details and examples:
GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a popular open-source library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats.

Example of converting a GeoTIFF file to a PNG file using GDAL:

```bash
gdal_translate input.tif output.png
```

Example of clipping a raster file using a bounding box:

```bash
gdalwarp -te xmin ymin xmax ymax input.tif clipped_output.tif
```

GDAL is a powerful tool for geospatial analysis and manipulation with a wide range of functionalities.
