Use Case: ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) is a flexible and scalable software infrastructure for building and coupling climate, weather, and data assimilation applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries that facilitate the coupling of different models and data sources.

Code details and examples:
- ESMF generally requires the creation of configuration files and scripts to run coupled models. Below is a basic example of a Python script using ESMF to create a simple grid, regrid data, and output the results to a NetCDF file.

Sample input files:
1. input_data.nc (NetCDF file containing input data)
2. output_data.nc (NetCDF file to store the results)

```python
import ESMF

grid = ESMF.Grid(filename='input_data.nc', filetype=ESMF.FileFormat.GRIDSPEC)

srcfield = ESMF.Field(grid, name='source_field')
dstfield = ESMF.Field(grid, name='destination_field')

regrid = ESMF.Regrid(srcfield, dstfield)

regrid()

dstfield.write(filename='output_data.nc', filetype=ESMF.FileFormat.GRIDSPEC)
```

This script defines a grid from an input NetCDF file, creates source and destination fields, performs a regridding operation, and writes the output to a new NetCDF file.

Note: The above script is a basic example and may need modifications based on the specific requirements of the coupled models.

To run the script, save it in a file (e.g., esmf_example.py) and execute it using Python:

```
python esmf_example.py
```

This will run the ESMF script and generate the output file with the regridded data.
