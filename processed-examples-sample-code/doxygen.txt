Use Case: Generates documentation from source code
Code details and examples:
```cpp
/**
 * @file main.cpp
 *
 * @brief A simple program to demonstrate Doxygen
 */

#include <iostream>

/**
 * @brief A simple function to add two numbers
 * @param a First number
 * @param b Second number
 * @return Sum of a and b
 */
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;
    int result = add(num1, num2);
    std::cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

To generate documentation using Doxygen, you would typically create a configuration file (Doxyfile) and run the doxygen command in the terminal:
```
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Make sure the Doxyfile is properly configured with the necessary settings based on your project requirements.
