Use Case: JAX (NumPy compatible numerical computing library)
Code details and examples: 
JAX is a numerical computing library that is compatible with NumPy but can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions. Here is an example code snippet to demonstrate how to use JAX:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import grad

def squared_loss(x, y):
    return jnp.sum((x - y) ** 2)

grad_squared_loss = grad(squared_loss)

x = jnp.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y = jnp.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

gradient = grad_squared_loss(x, y)
print(gradient)
```

In this code, we define a squared loss function and then use JAX to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input `x`.

To run the code, you can save it to a file (e.g., `jax_example.py`) and execute it using a Python interpreter that has JAX installed:
```
python jax_example.py
```
