I'm assuming you are referring to a system performance monitoring tool called "htop" which is commonly used in the context of HPC.

Use Case: Monitor system performance with htop
Code details and examples:
```
htop
```
This command will launch the htop tool, providing a real-time overview of the system's performance, including CPU and memory usage, processes running, and more.
