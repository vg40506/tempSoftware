souporcell is a tool for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis. Here is an example of how you can use souporcell:

Use Case: Assign cell genotypes using souporcell
Code details and examples:
1. Prepare your input data:
- Generate a counts matrix (e.g., in CSV format) from your single-cell RNA sequencing data.
- Prepare a whitelist file containing a list of known cell barcodes.

2. Run souporcell to assign cell genotypes:
```bash
souporcell -i counts_matrix.csv -w whitelist.txt -o output_directory
```

3. Interpret the results:
- The output will contain assigned cell genotypes based on the input data.

Note: Make sure to check the souporcell documentation for additional parameters and details on the input file formats.
