Use Case: Checkpointing and migration tool for distributed computing

Code details and examples:
- DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing) is a tool that allows users to transparently checkpoint and restart distributed computations.
- To checkpoint a program using DMTCP, you can use the following command:
  ```
  dmtcp_checkpoint <your_program>
  ```
- To restart a program from a checkpoint, you can use the following command:
  ```
  dmtcp_restart ckpt_<your_program>_PID_<pid>
  ```
- DMTCP can be used with various MPI implementations and other distributed computing frameworks to enable fault tolerance and migration capabilities.
