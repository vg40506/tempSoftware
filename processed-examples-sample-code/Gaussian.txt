Use Case: Quantum chemistry calculation
Code details and examples: 
Gaussian is a popular quantum chemistry software package used for electronic structure modeling. Below is an example of a sample input file for a simple Hartree-Fock calculation of water molecule using Gaussian:

Sample Input File (water_hf.com):
```
#HF/6-31G** optimization

Water HF optimization

0 1
O
H 1 0.96
H 1 0.96 2 104.5
```

To run the Gaussian calculation using the input file above, you would typically execute the command:
```
g16 < water_hf.com > water_hf.out
```

This command runs the Gaussian 16 executable with the input file `water_hf.com` and directs the output to the file `water_hf.out`.

Please note that the actual input file format and options may vary depending on the specific type of calculation and level of theory you wish to use in Gaussian.
