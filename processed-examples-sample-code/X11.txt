I see that you are looking for information related to the X Window System (X11), a windowing system for bitmap displays used in Unix-like operating systems.

Use Case: Display GUI applications remotely
Code details and examples:
1. Use SSH with X11 forwarding to display GUI applications from a remote server to your local machine.

Sample Input: N/A

Code:
```bash
ssh -X username@remote_server
```

2. Use Xserver software like Xming or XQuartz to display GUI applications from a remote server on your local machine.

Sample Input: N/A

Code: 
- For Xming on Windows:
After installing and running Xming, you can simply SSH into the remote server, and the GUI applications will display on your local machine.

- For XQuartz on macOS:
After installing and running XQuartz, you need to enable X11 forwarding in your SSH client before connecting to the remote server.

3. Use a desktop environment like XFCE that is optimized for remote connections using X11.

Sample Input: N/A

Code:
- Install XFCE on the remote server and then connect using SSH with X11 forwarding to display the XFCE desktop environment on your local machine.

Remember that for X11 forwarding to work, you need to have X11 clients installed on your local machine and have X11 forwarding enabled in your SSH client.
