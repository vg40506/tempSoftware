Use Case: Rendering library for pixel manipulation and compositing.

Code details and examples: 
Pixman is a low-level software library for pixel manipulation, providing pixel region userspace, accommodating image compositing. Below is an example of how to use Pixman with sample input files.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pixman.h>

int main() {
    // Create a new image surface
    pixman_image_t *image = pixman_image_create_bits(PIXMAN_a8r8g8b8, 100, 100, NULL, 400);

    // Fill the image with a red color
    pixman_image_fill_rect(image, 0xff0000ff, 0, 0, 100, 100);

    // Save the image to a PNG file
    pixman_image_write_to_file(image, PIXMAN_a8r8g8b8, "output.png", 0);

    // Destroy the image
    pixman_image_unref(image);

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code, you can use the following command:
```
gcc example.c -o example -lpixman-1
```

And to run the executable:
```
./example
```
