Use Case: Gene prediction using GeneMark
Code details and examples:
GeneMark is a popular gene prediction software that uses statistical models to predict genes in genomic sequences. Here is an example of how you can use GeneMark for gene prediction:

1. Prepare the input file in FASTA format:
```fasta
>example_genome
ATGCTGATCGTACGACTAGCATCGACTAGCATGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCATCGACTAGCTAGCA
```

2. Run GeneMark to predict genes in the input genome sequence:
```bash
gmhmmp -m <model> -n <output_file_name> <input_file_name>
```
Replace `<model>` with the appropriate model name (e.g., `gm` for GeneMarkS) and provide the input and output file names accordingly.

3. View the output file generated by GeneMark:
```bash
cat <output_file_name>
```
The output file will contain the predicted gene locations and other relevant information.

Please refer to the GeneMark documentation for more detailed information on the available models and parameters for gene prediction.
