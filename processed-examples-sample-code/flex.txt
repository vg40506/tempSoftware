Use Case: Flex (Fast lexical analyzer generator)

Code details and examples:
Flex is a tool for generating scanners, programs which recognized lexical patterns in text. It is often used in combination with a parser generator such as Bison.

Sample input file (lex file - example.l):
```
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}

%%
[a-z]    { printf("Lowercase letter found\n"); }
[0-9]    { printf("Digit found\n"); }
.        { printf("Special character found\n"); }
%%

int main() {
    yylex();
    return 0;
}
```

To generate C code from the lex file, run the following command:
```
flex example.l
```

This will generate a file named `lex.yy.c`. You can then compile and run the generated C code with a C compiler like gcc:
```
gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer
./lexer
```

You can provide input text to the program and see how it recognizes lexical patterns based on the rules defined in the input file.

Note: This is just a simple example to demonstrate the usage of Flex. More complex patterns and rules can be defined in the input file to create sophisticated lexical analyzers.
