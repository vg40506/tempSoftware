Use Case: TensorFlow's TensorBoard is a suite of visualization tools to help you understand, debug, and optimize your TensorFlow model.

Code details and examples:
To use TensorBoard, you need to log your model's training metrics and then launch TensorBoard to visualize them. Here is an example code snippet to log your training metrics:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

# Define your model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Set up TensorBoard callback
tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir='/path/to/log/directory', histogram_freq=1)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

After training your model and logging the metrics, you can launch TensorBoard from the command line with the following command:

```
tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/log/directory
```

This will start a local web server hosting TensorBoard. You can then open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6006` to view the TensorBoard dashboard and visualize your training metrics.
