Use Case: Visualization of machine learning models and logs with TensorBoard;
Code details and examples:
TensorBoard is a visualization toolkit provided with TensorFlow that allows you to visualize training metrics like loss and accuracy, as well as visualize the computational graph of your model.

To run TensorBoard, you need to first have TensorFlow installed, and then you can start TensorBoard with the following command in the terminal:
```
tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/logs
```

This will start a TensorBoard server which you can access in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:6006. You can then explore the various tabs to visualize different aspects of your model.

You can save logs from your TensorFlow model using the `tf.summary` module. Here is an example of how you can log scalar values (like loss and accuracy) to be visualized in TensorBoard:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a summary writer
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer("/path/to/logs")

with summary_writer.as_default():
    for step in range(num_steps):
        # Perform training step
        loss = # Calculate loss
        accuracy = # Calculate accuracy

        # Log metrics
        tf.summary.scalar("loss", loss, step=step)
        tf.summary.scalar("accuracy", accuracy, step=step)
```

Additionally, you can also log other types of data such as images, histograms, and embeddings for visualization in TensorBoard.
