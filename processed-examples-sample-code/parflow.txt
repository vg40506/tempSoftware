Use Case: ParFlow is a modeling software for modeling surface and subsurface hydrology processes. It is used for simulations of water movement in the soil and aquifers.

Code details and examples:
ParFlow input files typically include parameter files, domain files, and run files. Here is an example of an input file for running a ParFlow simulation:

Parameter File (pfset.prm):
```text
PFLO TRANSPORT_METHOD BDF2
PFLO SATUR_THRESHOLD 0.01
...
```

Domain File (domain.pfd):
```text
DOMAIN CONFIGURATION "domain.config"
DOMAIN DIMENSION 2
...
```

Run File (run.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mpirun -np 4 parflow < pfset.prm > pfout.log
```

To run the ParFlow simulation:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This is a basic example, and the actual input files and configurations may vary based on the specific simulation being performed.
