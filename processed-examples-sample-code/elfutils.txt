Use Case: Extract debugging information from ELF binaries using elfutils
Code details and examples:

Elfutils is a collection of utilities and libraries for handling ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. One common use case is to extract debugging information from ELF binaries using the `eu-readelf` tool.

Sample input file (binary file): `example_binary`

Command to extract debugging information:
```
eu-readelf -w -a example_binary
```

This command will display all debugging information present in the `example_binary` file. The `-w` flag is used to display DWARF information (debugging information) and the `-a` flag is used to display all headers of the ELF file.

Please note that you may need to adjust the command based on the specific information you are interested in extracting from the ELF binary.
