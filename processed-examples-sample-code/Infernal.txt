Use Case: Infernal is a software suite for searching DNA and RNA sequence databases for homologs of RNA structure and sequence motifs. It includes programs for aligning, searching, and annotating RNA homologs.

Code details and examples:
1. cmsearch (search a CM against a sequence database):
   - Input file format (CM file): 
     ```
     # STOCKHOLM 1.0
     # EXAMPLE CM
     // structure
     <HMMER3/f -> INFERNAL>
     EXAMPLE  CM
     ACC   1.0
     #=GF SQ SS_cons  :::::::::::::::
     #=GF TP      rf
     ```

   - Command to run cmsearch:
     ```
     cmsearch example.cm sequences.fa
     ```

2. cmalign (align sequences to a CM):
   - Input file format (CM file and sequences to align):
     ```
     # STOCKHOLM 1.0
     # EXAMPLE CM
     // structure
     <HMMER3/f -> INFERNAL>
     EXAMPLE  CM
     ACC   1.0
     #=GF SQ SS_cons  :::::::::::::::
     #=GF TP      rf
     ```

   - Command to run cmalign:
     ```
     cmalign example.cm sequences.fa > aligned_sequences.sto
     ```

3. cmbuild (build a CM from a multiple sequence alignment):
   - Input file format (Multiple sequence alignment):
     ```
     >seq1
     ACUGAUGCUAGC
     >seq2
     ACUGAUGCUAGC
     ```

   - Command to run cmbuild:
     ```
     cmbuild example.cm aligned_sequences.sto
     ```
