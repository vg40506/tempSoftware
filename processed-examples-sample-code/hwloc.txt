Use Case: HWLOC (Hardware Locality)

Code details and examples:
HWLOC (Hardware Locality) is a software package that provides a portable abstraction (and tool) for the hierarchical topology of modern architectures. It primarily helps applications identify the physical hardware topology of the system on which they're running.

Example of running lstopo command to visualize the topology of the system:
```
lstopo
```

For more advanced usage such as specifying input files or customizing the output format, you can refer to the official documentation: https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/

Note: The exact command and options may vary depending on the version of HWLOC installed on your system.
