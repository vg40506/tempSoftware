Use Case: Compilation of C code

Code details and examples:
```c
// sample.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the `sample.c` file using `gcc`, use the following command:
```bash
gcc sample.c -o sample
```

To run the compiled executable:
```bash
./sample
```
