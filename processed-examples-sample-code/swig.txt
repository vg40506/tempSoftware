Use Case: Code generation

Code details and examples: SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It allows developers to create interfaces for their C and C++ code in various scripting languages.

Here is an example of using SWIG with a simple C++ function to be wrapped for Python:

C++ Function (example.h):
```cpp
// example.h
int add(int a, int b);
```

SWIG interface file (example.i):
```
// example.i
%module example
%{
#include "example.h"
%}

%include "example.h"
```

To generate the Python wrapper code using SWIG, run the following command in the terminal:
```
swig -c++ -python example.i
```

This will generate two files, example_wrap.cxx and example.py. The example_wrap.cxx file contains the wrapper code that connects the C++ function with Python. You can then compile the wrapper code along with your C++ code to create a Python module that can be imported and used in Python scripts.
