Use Case: Linear algebra operations with OpenBLAS library

Code details and examples:
OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library that provides highly efficient linear algebra operations. Below is an example of how you can use OpenBLAS to perform matrix multiplication.

Sample input files:
Let's assume we have two input matrices, A and B, stored in text files `matrix_A.txt` and `matrix_B.txt` respectively. Each matrix is represented in row-major order.

matrix_A.txt
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

matrix_B.txt
```
9 8 7
6 5 4
3 2 1
```

Code:
```bash
# Assuming OpenBLAS is installed and linked
gcc gemm.c -o gemm -lopenblas
./gemm matrix_A.txt matrix_B.txt
```

gemm.c
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <cblas.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3; // Matrix dimensions
    float *A, *B, *C;

    A = malloc(m * k * sizeof(float));
    B = malloc(k * n * sizeof(float));
    C = malloc(m * n * sizeof(float));

    // Load matrices from files
    // Code for reading matrix_A.txt and matrix_B.txt into A and B respectively

    // Perform matrix multiplication
    cblas_sgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans, 
                m, n, k, 1.0, A, k, B, n, 0.0, C, n);

    // Print the result matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", C[i * n + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    free(A);
    free(B);
    free(C);

    return 0;
}
```

This is just a basic example of using OpenBLAS for matrix multiplication. Real-world usage may involve more complex operations and optimizations.
