I'm assuming you are interested in how to use TensorFlow for a specific use case. If you need information on a different aspect of TensorFlow, please let me know. 

Use Case: Training a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits using TensorFlow.

Code details and examples:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Define the model
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

To run this code, you can simply save it in a Python file (e.g., `mnist_classification.py`) and then execute it using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python mnist_classification.py
```
