Use Case: Computational geometry library.  
Code details and examples:  
Libvori is a computational geometry library for calculating the Voronoi diagram. Below is a sample input file format for calculating the Voronoi diagram using libvori:

Sample input file (points.txt):
```
3
1 1
2 3
4 2
```

Code:
```bash
libvori < points.txt
```

This command will calculate the Voronoi diagram for the points specified in the input file "points.txt".
