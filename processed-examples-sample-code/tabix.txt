Use Case: Indexing and querying tab-delimited files using tabix.

Code details and examples:
Tabix is a tool for indexing and querying tab-delimited files, such as VCF, BED, GFF, and various other formats. Here are some examples of how to use tabix:

1. Index a tab-delimited file:
```bash
tabix -p vcf my_file.vcf.gz
```
This command will create an index file named "my_file.vcf.gz.tbi" for the compressed VCF file "my_file.vcf.gz".

2. Query a tab-delimited file:
```bash
tabix my_file.vcf.gz chr1:10000-20000
```
This command will retrieve all records within the specified region (chr1:10000-20000) from the VCF file "my_file.vcf.gz".

3. Query a tab-delimited file with an index file:
```bash
tabix -R regions.bed my_file.vcf.gz
```
This command will retrieve all records that overlap with the regions specified in the BED file "regions.bed" from the VCF file "my_file.vcf.gz".

Note: The input files should be tab-delimited and sorted by chromosome and position. The chromosome names in the input files should match the chromosome names used in the queries.

Make sure to adjust the commands and file names according to your specific use case.
