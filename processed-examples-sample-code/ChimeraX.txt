Use Case: 3D visualization and analysis tool for molecular structures in bioinformatics.
Code details and examples:
ChimeraX can visualize atomic structures in various formats such as PDB, mmCIF, MRC, etc. Here is an example of loading a PDB file in ChimeraX:

1. Download a sample PDB file (e.g., 1CTF.pdb) from the Protein Data Bank.
2. Open ChimeraX.
3. Use the following command to load the PDB file:
```
open 1CTF.pdb
```

This will load the molecular structure in ChimeraX, and you can then explore and analyze the structure using the various tools provided by the software.
