Use Case: LASSO is a popular feature selection and regularization method in machine learning and statistics which can be used for regression analysis.

Code details and examples:

Install the required Python library:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Sample input data format: The input data should be in the form of a CSV file with the independent variables in the columns and the dependent variable in a separate column.

Sample code snippet to run LASSO regression using scikit-learn in Python:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Fit the LASSO regression model
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
predictions = lasso.predict(X_test_scaled)
```

Replace 'data.csv' and 'target_column' with your actual data file name and dependent variable column name.

Command to run the code: Save the code in a Python script (e.g., lasso_regression.py) and run it using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python lasso_regression.py
```
