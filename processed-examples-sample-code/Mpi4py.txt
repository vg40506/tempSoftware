Use Case: Parallel processing in Python using MPI with mpi4py
Code details and examples:
1. Installation: You can install mpi4py using pip:
```bash
pip install mpi4py
```
2. Sample input file (example.py) for running MPI code with mpi4py:
```python
from mpi4py import MPI

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
size = comm.Get_size()
rank = comm.Get_rank()

if rank == 0:
    data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
else:
    data = None

data = comm.bcast(data, root=0)
print(f"Process {rank} received data: {data}")
```
3. Running the MPI code with mpi4py (assuming you have MPI installed):
```bash
mpirun -n 4 python example.py
```
This will run the example.py script with 4 processes.

Please note that you need to have MPI installed on your system to run MPI codes.
