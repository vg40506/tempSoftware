Use Case: Electronic structure calculations with GPAW
Code details and examples:
GPAW (Grid-based Projector-Augmented Wave method) is a software package for DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations. Here is an example of running GPAW for a simple electronic structure calculation.

Sample input file (input.py):
```python
from gpaw import GPAW, PW
from ase import Atoms

# Define the structure (e.g., hydrogen molecule)
atoms = Atoms('H2', positions=[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0.74)])

# Set up the calculator
calc = GPAW(mode=PW(300),
            xc='PBE',
            setups='sg15',
            kpts=(4, 4, 4))

atoms.set_calculator(calc)

# Run the calculation
atoms.get_potential_energy()
```

To run the GPAW calculation using the input file above, you can use the following command:
```bash
gpaw-python input.py
```

This will perform a DFT calculation for a hydrogen molecule using the PBE exchange-correlation functional, a plane-wave energy cutoff of 300 eV, and a 4x4x4 k-point grid.

Please note that the input file and parameters can be modified based on the specific system and calculation details.
