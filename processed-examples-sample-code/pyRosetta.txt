Use Case: PyRosetta is a Python-based interface to the Rosetta molecular modeling suite, designed for protein structure prediction and design tasks.

Code details and examples:
```python
# Sample code to perform protein structure prediction with PyRosetta
from pyrosetta import init, pose_from_file
from pyrosetta.teaching import PyJobDistributor

# Initialize PyRosetta
init()

# Load a protein structure from a PDB file
pose = pose_from_file("input.pdb")

# Perform protein structure prediction using PyJobDistributor
jd = PyJobDistributor("output", 10, "score")
for decoy in range(1, 11):
    new_pose = pose.clone()
    # Your modeling or design task here
    jd.output_decoy(new_pose)
```

Command to run the script:
```
python your_script.py
```

Sample input files:
- input.pdb: Protein structure in PDB format

Requirements:
- PyRosetta library needs to be installed and properly configured
