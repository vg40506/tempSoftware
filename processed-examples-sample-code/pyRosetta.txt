Use Case: Protein structure prediction and design in Rosetta using Python interface pyRosetta

Code details and examples:
```python
# Sample code to perform protein structure prediction with pyRosetta
from pyrosetta import *
pyrosetta.init()

# Create a pose from a sequence
pose = pose_from_sequence("AAAAA")

# Setup a score function
scorefxn = get_fa_scorefxn()

# Perform energy minimization
print("Before minimization:", scorefxn(pose))
mm = MinMover()
mm.score_function(scorefxn)
mm.apply(pose)
print("After minimization:", scorefxn(pose))

# Output the minimized structure to a PDB file
pose.dump_pdb("minimized_structure.pdb")
```

Command to run the script (if applicable):
No direct command line usage, must be run within a Python environment with pyRosetta installed.
