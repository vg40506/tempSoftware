Use Case: Working with BAM files using htslib

Code details and examples: 

htslib is a software library for accessing common sequence file formats, including SAM and BAM formats. Here is an example of using htslib to view information from a BAM file.

```c
#include <htslib/sam.h>

int main() {
    samFile *fp = hts_open("example.bam", "r");
    bam_hdr_t *header = sam_hdr_read(fp);
    bam1_t *read = bam_init1();
    
    while (sam_read1(fp, header, read) >= 0) {
        printf("Read name: %s\n", bam_get_qname(read));
    }
    
    bam_destroy1(read);
    bam_hdr_destroy(header);
    sam_close(fp);

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet opens a BAM file "example.bam", reads the header, and then iterates through the reads in the file, printing out the read names.

To compile the code, you can use the following command (assuming the file is named `example.c`):

```bash
gcc -o example example.c -lhts
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./example
```
