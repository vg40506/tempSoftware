Use Case: Working with sequence alignment files using htslib. 

Code details and examples: 
Htslib is a software library for working with high-throughput sequencing data. One common use case for htslib is to manipulate and analyze sequence alignment files (SAM/BAM/CRAM format). Here is an example of using htslib to extract information from a BAM file.

Code:
```
#include <htslib/sam.h>

int main() {
    htsFile *bam_file = hts_open("example.bam", "r");
    bam_hdr_t *header = sam_hdr_read(bam_file);
    bam1_t *aln = bam_init1();

    while (sam_read1(bam_file, header, aln) >= 0) {
        // Access read information, e.g. position, sequence, quality, etc.
        // Example: Print read name
        printf("Read name: %s\n", bam_get_qname(aln));
    }

    bam_destroy1(aln);
    bam_hdr_destroy(header);
    hts_close(bam_file);

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the above code:
```
gcc -o extract_reads extract_reads.c -lhts
```

To run the compiled program:
```
./extract_reads
```
