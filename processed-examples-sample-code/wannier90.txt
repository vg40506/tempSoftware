Use Case: Wannier90 is a tool for generating maximally-localized Wannier functions from a set of Bloch states, typically obtained from DFT calculations.

Code details and examples:
Input files (example_hr.dat):
```
&input
    hr_file = 'wannier90_hr.dat'
    output_dir = './'
    prefix = 'silicon'
    postproc = True
    write_hr = True
    write_xyz = True
/
```

Code to run Wannier90:
```
wannier90.x -pp silicon
```

This command will run Wannier90 with the specified input file (example_hr.dat) to generate maximally-localized Wannier functions. Make sure to have the required input files (e.g., wannier90_hr.dat) and DFT output files ready before running Wannier90.
