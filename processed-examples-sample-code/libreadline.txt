Use Case: Read input from the user with readline library in Python

Code details and examples:
```python
import readline

def completer(text, state):
    options = ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'code']
    matches = [x for x in options if x.startswith(text)]
    if state < len(matches):
        return matches[state]
    else:
        return None

readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
readline.set_completer(completer)

while True:
    user_input = input('Enter a word: ')
    print('You entered:', user_input)
```

In this example, the `readline` library is used to enable tab-completion for user input. The `completer` function provides a list of options for autocompletion based on the user's input. The `parse_and_bind` function is used to bind the tab key for autocompletion, and `set_completer` is used to set the completer function. User input is read using the `input` function, and the program will continuously prompt the user for input until exited.
