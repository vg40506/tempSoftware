I am assuming you are referring to the GNU Screen utility, which is a terminal multiplexer that allows multiple sessions to be created, managed, and easily switched between.

Use Case: Create a new screen session
Code details and examples:
Code:
```bash
screen
```
This command will start a new screen session.

Use Case: List all screen sessions
Code details and examples:
Code:
```bash
screen -ls
```
This command will list all screen sessions currently running.

Use Case: Attach to a specific screen session
Code details and examples:
Code:
```bash
screen -r <session_id>
```
Replace `<session_id>` with the ID of the session you want to attach to.
