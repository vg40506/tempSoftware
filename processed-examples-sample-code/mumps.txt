Use Case: MUMPS (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) is a parallel sparse direct solver often used in large scale scientific computing applications for solving linear systems of equations.

Code details and examples:
MUMPS can be used through various programming interfaces such as Fortran, C, and Python. Below is an example of how to use MUMPS in Python to solve a linear system of equations.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve
from mumps import DMumpsContext

# Define the coefficient matrix A and the right-hand side b
A = csr_matrix([[4, -1, 0, 0, -1],
                [-1, 4, -1, 0, 0],
                [0, -1, 4, -1, 0],
                [0, 0, -1, 4, -1],
                [-1, 0, 0, -1, 4]])
b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Initialize the MUMPS solver
mumps = DMumpsContext()
mumps.set_symmetry(1)
mumps.set_silent()

# Factorize the matrix and solve the linear system
mumps.analyze(A)
mumps.factor(A)
x = mumps.solve(b)

print("Solution:", x)
```

Note: In the above code snippet, we first define the coefficient matrix `A` and the right-hand side `b`, then initialize the MUMPS solver using `DMumpsContext`. We analyze and factorize the matrix `A`, and finally solve the linear system to obtain the solution `x`.

To run the Python script, ensure that the MUMPS library is installed and accessible in your Python environment. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python mumps_example.py
```
