Use Case: Document Formatting with Groff

Code details and examples:
Groff is a typesetting system that is used for formatting documents. It uses a special language to define the layout and appearance of the document.

Sample input file ("example.ms"):
```
.\" Sample Groff document
.de Title
.ft B
.sp
\\$1
.sp
..
.de Section
.ft B
.sp
\\$1
.sp
..
Title("Sample Document")
Section("Section 1")
This is some text in section 1.
Section("Section 2")
This is some text in section 2.
```

To process the input file using Groff, you can use the following command:
```
groff -ms -Tpdf example.ms > example.pdf
```

This command will format the document according to the instructions in the input file "example.ms" using the Groff macro package (-ms) and generate a PDF output file named "example.pdf".
