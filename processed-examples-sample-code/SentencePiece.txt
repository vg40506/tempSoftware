Use Case: SentencePiece is a library for tokenizing and detokenizing text using subword units.
Code details and examples: 
Code:
```python
import sentencepiece as spm

# Train SentencePiece model
spm.SentencePieceTrainer.train(input='input.txt', model_prefix='m', vocab_size=1000)

# Load trained model
sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
sp.load('m.model')

# Tokenize input text
tokens = sp.encode('Hello, how are you?')
print(tokens) # [77, 6, 93, 187, 40, 79]

# Detokenize tokens
detokenized_text = sp.decode(tokens)
print(detokenized_text) # Hello, how are you?
```
Note: You need to have the SentencePiece library installed in your Python environment to run the code.
