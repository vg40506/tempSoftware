Chapel is an emerging parallel programming language designed for productivity at scale. It is especially well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Here is an example of how you can use Chapel:

Use Case: Parallel Hello World Program
Code details and examples:
Code:

```chapel
// Chapel program to print "Hello, World!" in parallel
writeln("Hello, World!") on Locales;
```

To run the Chapel program:

```bash
chpl hello.chpl
./hello
```

Note: Chapel code typically consists of .chpl files and can be compiled using the `chpl` compiler. You then can run the compiled binary.
