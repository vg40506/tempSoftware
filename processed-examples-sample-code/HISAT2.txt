Use Case: HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment tool for aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference genome.

Code details and examples:
1. Download the HISAT2 software from the official website and make sure it is in your PATH.
2. Prepare the index files for the reference genome using HISAT2-build:
```bash
hisat2-build reference_genome.fasta reference_index
```
3. Run the alignment using HISAT2:
```bash
hisat2 -x reference_index -1 forward_reads.fastq -2 reverse_reads.fastq -S output.sam
```
In the above command:
- `-x` specifies the path to the reference genome index generated using HISAT2-build.
- `-1` and `-2` specify the input files for paired-end forward and reverse reads.
- `-S` specifies the output SAM file.

Note: HISAT2 also provides options for single-end reads and other parameters to customize the alignment process.
