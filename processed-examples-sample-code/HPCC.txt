Use Case: High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC)
HPCC is an open-source, parallel computing platform used for big data processing and analytics. It provides a scalable, fault-tolerant system for processing large volumes of data.

Code details and examples:
1. Running a simple ECL (Enterprise Control Language) program on HPCC cluster:

```ecl
// myprogram.ecl
OUTPUT('Hello, HPCC world!');
```

To run the ECL program on HPCC cluster:
```bash
ecl myprogram.ecl
```

2. Submitting a job to HPCC cluster using ecl command line:

```bash
ecl run myprogram.ecl
```

3. Monitoring job status on HPCC cluster:

```bash
ecl status <job_id>
```

4. Checking cluster status:

```bash
eclagent query
```

Note: The above commands are general examples and may vary based on the specific configuration of the HPCC cluster.
