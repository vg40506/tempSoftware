Use Case: Visualization of 2D/3D scientific data  
Code details and examples:  
Tecplot is a software used for visualization of 2D and 3D scientific data. To use Tecplot, you can export your data in a supported format (e.g., ASCII) and then load the data into Tecplot for visualization.  
Here is an example of how you can create a sample data file in ASCII format and visualize it using Tecplot:

Sample Input File (data.txt):  
```
1 1 1  
2 4 8  
3 9 27  
4 16 64  
```

Code:  
1. Open Tecplot.
2. Click on File -> Load Data Files.
3. Select the data.txt file.
4. Customize the plot as needed (e.g., select plot type, add titles, adjust axes).
5. Click on Plot to visualize the data.
