Use Case: Visualization of meteorological data using NCL (NCAR Command Language)

Code details and examples:
NCL (NCAR Command Language) is a scripting language specifically designed for processing and visualizing data in the field of atmospheric and Earth sciences. Below is a simple example of plotting a contour map using NCL.

Sample input file (data.nc):
```
f = addfile("data.nc","r")
temperature = f->temperature
lon = f->lon
lat = f->lat
```

NCL code snippet:
```bash
ncl 'data.nc'
```

This command will run the NCL script to create a contour plot of the temperature data stored in data.nc file. 

Please ensure that you have NCL installed on your system and the necessary data files are available before running the script.
