Use Case: Linear Algebra  

Code details and examples:  
LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. LAPACK routines are typically called from a high-level interface like BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).

Here is an example of how you can use LAPACK to solve a system of linear equations Ax = b:

Sample input files:

Matrix A:
```
1.0 2.0 3.0
4.0 5.0 6.0
7.0 8.0 10.0
```

Vector b:
```
10.0
20.0
30.0
```

Code snippet in Fortran using LAPACK:
```fortran
program solve_linear_system
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: n = 3
    real(kind=8) :: A(n,n), b(n)
    integer :: ipiv(n), info
    
    A = reshape([1.0d0, 4.0d0, 7.0d0, 2.0d0, 5.0d0, 8.0d0, 3.0d0, 6.0d0, 10.0d0], [n,n])
    b = [10.0d0, 20.0d0, 30.0d0]
    
    call DGESV(n, 1, A, n, ipiv, b, n, info)
    
    if (info == 0) then
        print *, "Solution x:"
        print *, b
    else
        print *, "Failed to solve the system."
    end if
end program solve_linear_system
```

Command to compile and run (assuming LAPACK is linked):
```bash
gfortran -o solve_linear_system solve_linear_system.f -llapack -lblas
./solve_linear_system
```
