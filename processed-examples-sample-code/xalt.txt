Use Case: Profiling HPC jobs with XALT

Code details and examples:
XALT (XALT Accounting and Logging Tool) is a program that tracks program executions on HPC systems to provide job profiling and usage statistics. To use XALT, first, load the XALT module on the HPC system.

Sample code to load XALT module:
```bash
module load xalt
```

Once the XALT module is loaded, you can submit your job scripts as usual. XALT will automatically track the execution of your job and generate profiling information.

To view the job profiling information collected by XALT, you can use the `xalt` command with appropriate options. For example, to view a summary of user job statistics, you can use the following command:

```bash
xalt --user-summary
```

Additionally, you can use various options with the `xalt` command to get detailed information about job executions, module loads, and more. Refer to the XALT documentation for a full list of available options and commands.
