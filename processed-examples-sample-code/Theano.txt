In the current landscape, Tensorflow and PyTorch have largely replaced Theano in the deep learning community. Hence, I will provide a use case for PyTorch as it is the closest alternative.

Use Case: PyTorch
Code details and examples:
Sample Input (Python code):
```python
import torch

# Create two tensors
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
y = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix multiplication
result = torch.matmul(x, y)

print(result)
```

In this sample input, we import the PyTorch library, create two tensors `x` and `y`, and perform a matrix multiplication using the `torch.matmul()` function.

To run the code, save it in a Python script (e.g., `matrix_multiplication.py`) and run it using Python:
```
python matrix_multiplication.py
```

This will output the result of the matrix multiplication of tensors `x` and `y`.

Note: The provided code example is a basic illustration of using PyTorch. For more advanced use cases, such as building neural networks, additional libraries and functions would need to be incorporated.
