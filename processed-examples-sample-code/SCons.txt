Use Case: Build automation tool
Code details and examples:
SCons is a software construction tool that is an alternative to other build tools such as Make. It uses Python scripts as configuration files for software builds. Below is a simple example of a SConstruct file to compile a C program.

SConstruct:
```python
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
```

hello.c:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To build the program using SCons, you can run the following command:
```bash
scons
```

This will compile the `hello.c` file and generate an executable called `hello`.
