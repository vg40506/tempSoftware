Use Case: edgeR is a Bioconductor package in R for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.

Code details and examples:
```
# Load the edgeR library
library(edgeR)

# Import count data
counts <- as.matrix(read.csv("counts.csv", row.names = 1))

# Create a DGEList object
d <- DGEList(counts = counts)

# Filter lowly expressed genes
d <- d[rowSums(cpm(d) > 1) >= 2, , keep.lib.sizes = FALSE]

# Perform differential expression analysis
design <- model.matrix(~group, data = colData(d))
d <- estimateDisp(d, design)
fit <- glmFit(d, design)
lrt <- glmLRT(fit, coef = 2)
topTags(lrt)
```

In the above code:
- "counts.csv" is the input file containing count data for RNA-seq samples.
- The code reads the count data, filters lowly expressed genes, performs differential expression analysis, and returns the top significant genes.

Command to run: Run each line of code in an R environment.
