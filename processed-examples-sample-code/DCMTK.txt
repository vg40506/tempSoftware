Use Case: DCMTK (DICOM Toolkit) is a collection of libraries and applications for medical imaging. It supports the DICOM standard and provides various tools for working with DICOM files.

Code details and examples:
1. List DICOM tags in a file:
```bash
dcmdump input.dcm
```

2. Convert a DICOM file to a different transfer syntax:
```bash
dcmtrans -i input.dcm -o output.dcm +te
```

3. Anonymize DICOM files by removing patient information:
```bash
dcmodify -nb -de -ie input.dcm -of output.dcm
```

4. Query a DICOM server for information:
```bash
echoscu +r -aec MY_AE_TITLE SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT
```

5. Send DICOM files to a remote server:
```bash
storescu +r -aec MY_AE_TITLE SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT input1.dcm input2.dcm
```

Note: Replace input.dcm with the path to the DICOM file you want to work with. Adjust the options as needed for your specific use case.
