Use Case: libevent is a library that provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout. It is commonly used in network programming for creating event-driven programs.

Code details and examples:
```c
#include <event2/event.h>

void event_callback(evutil_socket_t fd, short events, void *arg) {
    // Callback function to handle events
    // You can write your custom logic here
}

int main() {
    struct event_base *base = event_base_new();
    
    struct event *ev = event_new(base, /* file descriptor */, EV_READ | EV_PERSIST, event_callback, NULL);
    // Add the event to the event base
    event_add(ev, NULL);

    // Start the event loop
    event_base_dispatch(base);

    // Cleanup
    event_free(ev);
    event_base_free(base);

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code:
```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -levent
```

To run the compiled program:
```bash
./my_program
```
