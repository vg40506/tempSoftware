Use Case: BUSCO is a software package used for assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness based on evolutionarily-informed expectations of gene content.

Code details and examples:

Input file format:
- Genome assembly file in FASTA format

Command to run BUSCO:
```
busco -i genome.fasta -l lineage_dataset -o output_name -m genome
```

In this command:
- -i: input file (genome assembly in FASTA format)
- -l: lineage dataset to be used for benchmarking (e.g., eukaryota_odb10 for eukaryotic genomes)
- -o: output name prefix
- -m: mode (genome for genome assembly assessment)

Output:
BUSCO will generate an output folder containing various files with statistics on the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation.

Note: The specific lineage dataset to be used (-l option) may differ based on the type of genome being assessed (e.g., eukaryotic, bacterial, archaeal).

Example:
```
busco -i genome.fasta -l eukaryota_odb10 -o genome_busco -m genome
```
