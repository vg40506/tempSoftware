Use Case: GNU Debugger (gdb)
Code details and examples:
GNU Debugger (gdb) is used to debug programs written in C, C++, and other programming languages. It allows users to inspect what a program is doing at different stages and helps in identifying and fixing bugs in the code.

Example:
Assume we have a C program named "example.c" which contains a logical error. To debug this program using gdb, we can follow these steps:

1. Compile the program with debugging symbols:
```bash
gcc -g -o example example.c
```

2. Start gdb and load the executable:
```bash
gdb ./example
```

3. Set breakpoints, run the program, and analyze variables:
```bash
break main
run
```

4. Step through the program to identify the issue:
```bash
next
print variable_name
```

5. Analyze the program flow and fix the bug.

Command to run:
```bash
gdb <executable_name>
```
