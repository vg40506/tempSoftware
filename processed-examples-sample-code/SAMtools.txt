Use Case: SAMtools is a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data in SAM/BAM format.

Code details and examples:
1. View the content of a BAM file: 
```bash
samtools view input.bam
```
2. Sort a BAM file by coordinates: 
```bash
samtools sort input.bam -o sorted.bam
```
3. Index a sorted BAM file: 
```bash
samtools index sorted.bam
```
4. Call variants from a sorted and indexed BAM file:
```bash
samtools mpileup -uf reference.fa sorted.bam | bcftools call -cv - > variants.vcf
```

Input files:
- BAM file: Binary Alignment/Map format file containing aligned sequencing reads.
- Reference.fa: Reference genome file in FASTA format.

Make sure to replace `input.bam` and `reference.fa` with the actual file paths in the above commands.
