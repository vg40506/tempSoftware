Use Case: Magma is a dense linear algebra library that provides highly efficient routines for computations on hybrid GPU-based systems.

Code details and examples: 
Magma requires input files in specific formats depending on the operation being performed. Below is an example of how you can use Magma to perform LU factorization on a matrix.

```c
#include <magma_v2.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    magma_init();

    magma_int_t n = 3;
    magma_int_t lda = n;
    magma_int_t info;

    double *a = (double*)malloc(n*n*sizeof(double));
    // Fill in the matrix a with your input

    magma_dgetrf(n, n, a, lda, NULL, &info);

    if (info == 0) {
        printf("LU factorization successful.\n");
    } else {
        printf("LU factorization failed.\n");
    }

    magma_finalize();

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code, assuming the file is named `lu_magma.c`, you can use the following command:
```bash
gcc lu_magma.c -o lu_magma -I /path_to_magma/include -L /path_to_magma/lib -lmagma -lcula -lcublas -lcudart
```

To run the executable:
```bash
./lu_magma
```
