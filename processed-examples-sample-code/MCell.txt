Use Case: MCell is a Monte Carlo modeling and simulation software used for creating spatially realistic models of cellular signaling and molecular processes.

Code details and examples:
1. Input files: MCell requires a model file in ".mdl" format and a configuration file in ".cfg" format to run simulations.
2. Sample model file (sample.mdl):
```plaintext
BeginModel
  Species A
    D 1e-6
  EndSpecies
  Species B
    D 1e-6
  EndSpecies
  Reaction A + B -> C
    k 1e-3
  EndReaction
EndModel
```
3. Sample configuration file (sample.cfg):
```plaintext
BeginSimulation
  Iterations 1000
EndSimulation
```
4. Command to run MCell simulation:
```bash
mcell sample.mdl sample.cfg
```
