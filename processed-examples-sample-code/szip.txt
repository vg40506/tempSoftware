Use Case: Data compression with szip  
Code details and examples:  
szip is a compression program used for compressing and decompressing data. It is typically used in conjunction with HDF files to reduce the storage space required for large datasets.

To compress a file using szip, you can use the following command:

```bash
szip input_file.txt
```

To decompress a file using szip, you can use the following command:

```bash
szip -d input_file.txt.sz
```

Please note that szip works with HDF files by default and may require the HDF library to be installed for full functionality.
