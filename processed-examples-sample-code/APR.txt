Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library which provides a predictable and consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations. 

Use Case: Use Apache Portable Runtime for developing C/C++ applications that are intended to be portable across different platforms.

Code details and examples:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <apr-1/apr_general.h>

int main() {
    apr_initialize();
    
    // Your code here
    
    apr_terminate();
    return 0;
}
```

For sample input files and further details specific to the application being developed, you would need to refer to the documentation and examples provided by the Apache Portable Runtime library.

Note: The above code is just a simple example to demonstrate the initialization and termination of the APR library.
