Use Case: System Libraries

---

Code details and examples:

System libraries are essential libraries that provide fundamental functionalities for the operating system and are often required by many other software packages. Some common system libraries include `libc`, `libm`, `libpthread`, and `librt`. These libraries are typically linked to during the compilation of programs to provide basic functions.

A simple C program that uses `libc` to perform a basic mathematical operation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;
    int result = a + b;

    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

To compile this program using `libc`, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lc
```

In this command, the `-lc` flag tells the compiler to link the program with the `libc` library.

Similarly, other system libraries can be linked in a similar way based on the requirements of the program being compiled.
