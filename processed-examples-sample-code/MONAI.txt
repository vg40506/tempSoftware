Use Case: MONAI is a PyTorch-based, open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. It provides domain-optimized neural networks, pre-processing transforms, evaluation metrics, and other utilities for medical image analysis tasks.

Code details and examples:

Sample input files: Medical images in DICOM format
Format required: DICOM or NIfTI files
Specifications: Input images should be in the appropriate medical imaging format supported by MONAI.

```python
import torch
from monai.data import Dataset
from monai.transforms import Compose, LoadImaged, AddChanneld, Resized

# Define a Dataset with transforms
data = [{"image": "path_to_image1.nii.gz"}, {"image": "path_to_image2.nii.gz"}]
transforms = Compose([LoadImaged(image_only=True), AddChanneld(), Resized(keys="image", spatial_size=(128, 128))])
dataset = Dataset(data, transform=transforms)

# Access and preprocess image data
for idx in range(len(dataset)):
    data_dict = dataset[idx]
    image = data_dict["image"]
    print(image.shape)
```

To run the above example, save it in a Python script and execute it using a Python interpreter.

Command to run: `python your_script.py`
