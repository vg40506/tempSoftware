I am assuming you are asking for information regarding the 'libx11' library used for X Window System protocol support.

Use Case: X11 Programming 
Code details and examples:
The libx11 library provides functions for X Window System protocol support. A sample program using libx11 to create a simple window is shown below:

```c
#include <X11/Xlib.h>

int main() {
    Display *display = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
    Window window = XCreateSimpleWindow(display, DefaultRootWindow(display), 0, 0, 200, 100, 0, 0, 0);
    XMapWindow(display, window);
    XFlush(display);
    sleep(10);
    XCloseDisplay(display);
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the program, you can use the following command (assuming the file is named 'sample.c'):

```bash
gcc sample.c -lX11 -o sample
```

To run the compiled program, simply execute:

```bash
./sample
```

This will create a simple X Window with a dimensions of 200x100 pixels. The window will be displayed for 10 seconds before closing.
