Use Case: IDE for R programming  
Code details and examples:  
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. Users can write, compile, and debug R code in RStudio.  

Input files: R script files (.R)  
Sample input file content (sample_script.R):  
```
# This is a sample R script
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

Command to run:  
No specific command required as RStudio provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for R programming. Users can simply open RStudio, create a new script, paste the code snippet, and run it using the "Run" button.
