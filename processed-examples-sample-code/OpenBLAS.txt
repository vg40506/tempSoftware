Use Case: Linear algebra library for HPC computing

Code details and examples:
1. Sample Input file (matrix multiplication in Python):
```python
import numpy as np
import time
import os

# Create two random matrices
A = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
B = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)

start_time = time.time()

C = np.dot(A, B)  # Matrix multiplication using OpenBLAS

print("Time taken: %s seconds" % (time.time() - start_time))
```

2. Command to run the code (assuming Python is installed):
```bash
python matrix_multiplication.py
```

3. Expected Output: 
```
Time taken: X seconds
```

Note: OpenBLAS provides optimized implementations of basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) and linear algebra routines, leading to faster computations for matrix operations in high-performance computing applications.
