Use Case: Quantum calculations in materials science

Code details and examples:
VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package) is a software package for performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is widely used in materials science research.

Input files for VASP typically include:
- INCAR: Contains parameters for the calculation
- POSCAR: Specifies the atomic structure
- POTCAR: Defines the pseudopotentials
- KPOINTS: Sets the k-point mesh for the calculation

Below is an example of a VASP input file (INCAR):
```
SYSTEM = Example
ENCUT = 400
ISMEAR = 0
EDIFF = 1E-6
```

To run VASP, you would typically execute the following command:
```
vasp_std
```
