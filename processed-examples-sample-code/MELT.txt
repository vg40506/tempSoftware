Use Case: Structural variant analysis with MELT
Code details and examples:
MELT (Mobile Element Locator Tool) is a software package designed for the detection of transposable element insertions in whole genome sequencing data.

Sample input files:
- Input BAM file containing the aligned sequencing reads.
- Reference genome file in FASTA format.

Code:
```
melt -w -h <reference_genome.fasta> -b <input.bam> -t <threads>
```

Note: Make sure to replace <reference_genome.fasta>, <input.bam>, and <threads> with the actual paths and values.

Running this command will analyze the input data and detect transposable element insertions in the genome.
