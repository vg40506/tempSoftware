Use Case: Structural variant analysis
Code details and examples:
MELT is a software package used for detecting structural variants (SVs) from next-generation sequencing data. It can identify insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations.

Sample input files:
- Input BAM file(s) containing aligned sequencing reads
- Reference genome FASTA file

Format required: BAM, FASTA

Code:
melt -B input.bam -R ref_genome.fasta -o output_folder

Note: This is a simplified example. Please refer to the MELT documentation for more detailed command options and input file specifications.
