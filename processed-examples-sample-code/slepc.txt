Use Case: SLEPc is a software library for the solution of large scale sparse eigenvalue problems. It is built on top of PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation. 

Code details and examples:
SLEPc does not have a standalone executable, it needs to be used in conjunction with PETSc in your own C, C++, or Fortran code. Below is an example of using SLEPc and PETSc together in a C code for solving a dense Hermitian eigenvalue problem.

```c
#include <slepceps.h>
#include <petscksp.h>

int main(int argc, char **args)
{
    SlepcInitialize(&argc, &args, NULL, NULL);

    // Create matrices, vectors, and solve eigenvalue problem using SLEPc and PETSc functions

    SlepcFinalize();
    return 0;
}
```

For detailed documentation and examples, please refer to the SLEPc documentation: https://slepc.upv.es/documentation/

Note: SLEPc is primarily used through the PETSc interface and does not have standalone command-line tools.
