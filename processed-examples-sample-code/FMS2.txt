Use Case: Scientific tools  
Code details and examples:  
FMS2 is a software package for computational chemistry. It requires input files in FMS format to run simulations.

Example input file (input.fms):
```
title
This is a sample input file for FMS2
end

geometry
O 0.0 0.0 0.0
H 1.0 0.0 0.0
H 0.0 1.0 0.0
end

basis
O
cc-pVDZ
H
cc-pVDZ
end

energy
end
```

To run FMS2 with the input file, you can use the following command:
```
fms2 input.fms
```
