I am assuming you are looking for examples related to character set conversion using libiconv. 

Use Case: Character set conversion using libiconv
Code details and examples:
To convert a file from one character set to another using libiconv, you can use the following command:

```bash
iconv -f <from_encoding> -t <to_encoding> input_file > output_file
```

For example, to convert a file named `input.txt` from UTF-8 to ASCII encoding, you can run:

```bash
iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII input.txt > output.txt
```

Make sure to replace `<from_encoding>` and `<to_encoding>` with the appropriate character set encodings.
