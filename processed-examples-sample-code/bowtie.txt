Use Case: Bowtie is a fast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to a large reference genome.

Code details and examples:
1. Indexing the reference genome:
```bash
bowtie-build reference_genome.fasta reference_index
```
- `reference_genome.fasta` is the file containing the reference genome sequences.
- `reference_index` is the basename for the index files to be created.

2. Aligning reads to the reference genome:
```bash
bowtie -x reference_index -1 read1.fastq -2 read2.fastq -S aligned_reads.sam
```
- `-x reference_index` specifies the basename of the index files.
- `-1 read1.fastq` and `-2 read2.fastq` are the paired-end read files to be aligned.
- `-S aligned_reads.sam` specifies the output file in SAM format.

3. Convert SAM file to BAM file (optional):
```bash
samtools view -S -b aligned_reads.sam > aligned_reads.bam
```
- `aligned_reads.sam` is the SAM format output from Bowtie.
- `aligned_reads.bam` is the BAM format output.

4. Sorting and indexing BAM file (optional):
```bash
samtools sort aligned_reads.bam -o aligned_reads_sorted.bam
samtools index aligned_reads_sorted.bam
```
- `aligned_reads.bam` is the unsorted BAM file.
- `aligned_reads_sorted.bam` is the sorted BAM file.

Note: Make sure to replace the file names and paths with the actual ones in your case.
