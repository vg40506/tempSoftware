Use Case: Use Autoconf to automatically configure source code packages.
Code details and examples:
Autoconf is typically used in conjunction with Automake and Libtool to generate configure scripts. Here is an example of how a simple configure.ac file might look:

```
AC_INIT([hello], [1.0], [bug-hello@example.com])
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
AC_PROG_CC
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

To generate the configure script, you would run:

```
autoconf
```

This would generate the configure script from the configure.ac file.
