Use Case: Linear programming with the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK)

Code details and examples:
GLPK is an open-source software package written in C that is useful for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. GLPK supports the input format of both MPS (Mathematical Programming System) and LP (Linear Programming) files.

Sample MPS input file (example.mps):
```
NAME          Example
ROWS
 N  cost
 L  limit
COLUMNS
    cost  x1        cost  x2        limit  lim
    1     x1        2     x2        lim    x1    1
RHS
    rhs
    5
BOUNDS
 UP BOUND
    x1
    3
ENDATA
```

Sample LP input file (example.lp):
```
maximize
 obj: x1 + 2 x2
subject to
 con: x1 <= 1
 con: x1 + x2 >= 3
bounds
 x1 <= 3
end
```

To solve an LP/MIP problem using GLPK, you can use the following command:
```
glpsol --lp example.lp
```

This command will solve the LP/MIP problem defined in the "example.lp" file. You can replace "example.lp" with the path to your own LP/MIP input file.
