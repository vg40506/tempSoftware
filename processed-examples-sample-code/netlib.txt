Netlib is a repository of high-quality software written in a variety of programming languages, particularly for numerical computation and linear algebra.

Use Case: Linear Algebra Matrix Multiplication
Code details and examples:
Input file format (matrices A and B):
```
# sample input file for matrix A
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

# sample input file for matrix B
3 3
9 8 7
6 5 4
3 2 1
```

Code to perform matrix multiplication using the NETLIB suite of linear algebra libraries:
```bash
$ cd netlib/blas
$ make
$ ./matrix_multiply <input_matrix_A> <input_matrix_B>
```

This code snippet assumes that there is a matrix multiplication program available in the NETLIB's BLAS library and provides input matrices A and B as arguments.

Please note that the exact implementation and usage may vary depending on the specific software within the netlib repository.
