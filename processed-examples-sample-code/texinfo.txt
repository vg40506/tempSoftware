Use Case: texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both online information and printed output. It is primarily used in software documentation to create manuals.

Code details and examples:
- Create a texinfo file (e.g., sample.texinfo):
```
\input texinfo
@c %**start of header
@setfilename sample.info
@settitle Sample Manual
@c %**end of header
@chapter Introduction
This is a sample Texinfo file.
@end chapter
```

- Convert the texinfo file to an Info file:
```
makeinfo sample.texinfo
```

- View the generated Info file:
```
info sample.info
```
