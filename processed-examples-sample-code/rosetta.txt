Use Case: Protein structure prediction and design

Code details and examples:
Rosetta is a suite of software tools for protein structure prediction and design. One of the common tasks performed using Rosetta is protein structure prediction or ab initio folding.

Example of running ab initio folding with Rosetta:
```
$ROSETTA3/bin/AbinitioRelax.default -s input.pdb -nstruct 10
```

In the example above, input.pdb is the input PDB file of the protein structure for which ab initio folding will be performed. The -nstruct flag specifies the number of structures to generate during the folding process.

Please note that the actual command may vary slightly depending on the version of Rosetta and the specific task you are performing.
