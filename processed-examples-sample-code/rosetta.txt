Use Case: Molecular modeling and protein structure prediction with Rosetta.

Code details and examples:
**Rosetta** is a software suite for modeling and designing proteins, and it is commonly used in structural bioinformatics and protein engineering.

To run Rosetta, you typically need a command line and input files in PDB format for the protein structure you want to model or design.

For example, to perform protein structure prediction with Rosetta:

1. Download the Rosetta software suite from the RosettaCommons website.
2. Prepare an input PDB file of the protein structure you want to predict.
3. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
/path/to/rosetta/main/source/bin/AbinitioRelax.default.linuxgccrelease -in:file:s input.pdb -nstruct 10
```

This command performs an ab initio protein structure prediction using Rosetta with 10 output models.

Please refer to the Rosetta documentation for more specific command options and usage instructions.
