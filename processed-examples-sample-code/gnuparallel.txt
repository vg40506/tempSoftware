Use Case: Parallelizing tasks using GNU Parallel
Code details and examples: 

GNU Parallel is a command-line tool that allows for easy parallelization of shell commands. Here is an example of how you can use GNU Parallel to parallelize a simple task of echoing numbers from 1 to 10:

1. Create a file named 'input.txt' with numbers from 1 to 10 (each number on a new line):
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

2. Use GNU Parallel to echo each number in parallel:
```
cat input.txt | parallel echo {}
```

This command will run the 'echo' command for each number in parallel, resulting in output similar to the following:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

You can parallelize a wide range of tasks using GNU Parallel by customizing the command within the parallel command construct.
