Use Case: LibXML is a library for parsing and manipulating XML documents.

Code details and examples:
LibXML can be used with various programming languages like C, Perl, Python, etc. Here is an example using Python to parse an XML file with LibXML:

Sample input file (input.xml):
```xml
<root>
    <child>This is a child node</child>
</root>
```

Python code to parse input.xml using LibXML:
```python
from lxml import etree

# Parse the XML file
tree = etree.parse("input.xml")
root = tree.getroot()

# Access and print the value of the child node
child_node = root.find("child")
print(child_node.text)
```

Command to run the Python code (assuming the file is named parse_xml.py):
```bash
python parse_xml.py
```
