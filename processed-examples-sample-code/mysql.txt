Use Case: MySQL is a popular relational database management system widely used in web applications for data storage and retrieval.

Code details and examples:
1. Connecting to a MySQL database using Python:
```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection to the MySQL server
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="username",
  password="password",
  database="mydatabase"
)

# Create a cursor object
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Execute an SQL query
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable")

# Fetch the result
result = mycursor.fetchall()
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

2. Running a SQL query from the command line:
```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name -e "SELECT * FROM mytable;"
```

3. Sample input file format for loading data:
```
id, name, age
1, John, 30
2, Alice, 25
3, Bob, 35
```

4. Loading data from a CSV file into a MySQL table:
```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/data.csv'
INTO TABLE mytable
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

Please note that the actual commands may vary based on your MySQL server setup and database schema.
