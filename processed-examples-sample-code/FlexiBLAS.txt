I'm not familiar with a software package called FlexiBLAS. However, if you are looking for a flexible Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) library, you might be referring to BLIS (BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software Framework).

Use Case: BLIS matrix-matrix multiplication
Code details and examples:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "blis.h"

#define N 3
#define M 3
#define K 3

int main()
{
    double alpha = 1.0;
    double beta = 0.0;
    double A[N][K] = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
                      {4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
                      {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}};
    double B[K][M] = {{1.0, 0.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 1.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}};
    double C[N][M] = {{0.0, 0.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 0.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}};

    bli_dgemm(BLIS_NO_TRANSPOSE, BLIS_NO_TRANSPOSE, N, M, K,
              &alpha, (double*)A, 1, K, (double*)B, 1, M,
              &beta, (double*)C, 1, M);

    // Print result matrix C
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            printf("%lf ", C[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
To run the above code using BLIS, you need to link against the BLIS library during compilation. The specific compiler command may vary depending on your system setup and BLIS installation.

Please make sure you have BLIS installed and configured correctly before attempting to compile and run the above code.
