Use Case: gperf is a perfect hash function generator. It transforms key values into perfect hash functions by generating C code for a hash table. 

Code details and examples:
```bash
$ gperf input_file.txt > output_file.c
```

In this command:
- `input_file.txt` is a text file containing a list of keys.
- `output_file.c` will contain the generated C code for the hash table.
