Use Case: Statistical modeling and analysis with Python.

Code details and examples:
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Sample input data
X = [[1, 2], [1, 5], [1, 8]]
y = [3, 6, 9]

# Fit a linear regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Print summary of the regression results
print(results.summary())
```
Note: This is just a simple example of how you can use the statsmodels library for statistical modeling in Python. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific analysis you are performing.
