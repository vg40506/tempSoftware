Use Case: Phylogenetic tree inference using RAxML

Code details and examples:
RAxML is a widely used program for phylogenetic tree inference based on maximum likelihood. It supports various substitution models and can handle large datasets efficiently. Below is an example of running RAxML with a DNA alignment file.

**Sample Input Files:**

- Alignment file (input.phy):
```
4 10
Seq1    ATCGATCGAT
Seq2    ATCGATAGCT
Seq3    ATCGATCGAT
Seq4    ATCGTAGCTA
```

**Command to Run:**
```
raxml -s input.phy -m GTRGAMMA -n output
```

- `-s`: Input alignment file
- `-m`: Model specification (here using GTR+GAMMA model)
- `-n`: Output file prefix

Once RAxML finishes running, you can find the output files with the phylogenetic trees in the RAxML_bestTree and RAxML_bipartitions files.

Please note that the actual command may vary depending on the version and installation of RAxML.
