Use Case: Data compression
Code details and examples:
Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modeling. It is particularly effective for web content compression.

Sample Input File (input.txt):
This is a sample input file for Brotli compression.
