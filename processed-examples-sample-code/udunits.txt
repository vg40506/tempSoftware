Use Case: Units conversion and manipulation ; udunits is a library for working with units of physical quantities. It allows for unit conversions, arithmetic operations between quantities with different units, and supports a wide range of unit types.

Code details and examples:
1. Sample input file (input.txt):
```
23 Celsius
```

2. Sample code snippet to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using udunits package:
```python
from udunits import Unit

with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.readline().split()
    value = float(data[0])
    unit = Unit(data[1])

# Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
if unit.is_convertible_to(Unit("degF")):
    new_value = unit.convert(value, Unit("degF"))
    print(new_value)
else:
    print("Units are not compatible for conversion.")
```

3. Command to run the code:
```
python your_script.py
```
