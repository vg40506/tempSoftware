Use Case: pigz is a parallel implementation of gzip that uses multiple processors and multiple cores for compression and decompression.

Code details and examples:
1. Compression:
```bash
pigz input_file.txt
```
This command will compress the input_file.txt using pigz, which will utilize multiple processors for faster compression.

2. Decompression:
```bash
pigz -d input_file.txt.gz
```
This command will decompress the input_file.txt.gz using pigz.

3. Parallel compression with specified number of threads:
```bash
pigz -p 4 input_file.txt
```
This command will compress the input_file.txt using pigz with 4 threads (processors).

4. Decompress with stdout:
```bash
pigz -dc input_file.txt.gz
```
This command will decompress the file input_file.txt.gz and write the output to stdout.

Input file format: Input files can be any text or binary files that need to be compressed or decompressed.

Make sure to adjust the number of threads according to the available resources on your system for optimal performance.
