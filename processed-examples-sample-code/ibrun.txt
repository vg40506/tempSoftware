Use Case: ibrun is a utility for running MPI jobs on HPC clusters. It is commonly used to launch parallel applications across multiple nodes.

Code details and examples:
```bash
ibrun <executable>
```

In this example, suppose you have a compiled MPI executable named "my_mpi_program". You can run it using ibrun as follows:

```bash
ibrun my_mpi_program
```

This will launch the MPI executable on the allocated nodes of the HPC cluster.
