Use Case: ccache is a compiler cache that speeds up recompilation by caching previous compilations

Code details and examples:
1. Usage:
```
ccache [options] compiler [compiler options]
```

2. Example with GCC:
Let's assume you have a C file named "example.c" and you want to compile it using GCC with ccache.
```
ccache gcc -o example example.c
```

3. Example with sample input files:
You can use ccache with any compiler and its options like you normally would without ccache. The caching will happen automatically.

4. Specifications and details in input files:
No specific input file format is required for ccache. It automatically caches compiled object files based on the compiler and its options.

Note:
Make sure ccache is installed and in your PATH before using it.
