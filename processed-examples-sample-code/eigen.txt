I'm not sure which specific software package you are referring to. Here are two possibilities:

1. If you are referring to Eigen, which is a C++ template library for linear algebra, the input file format and code examples would vary depending on the specific linear algebra operations you want to perform.

2. If you are referring to eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the context of linear algebra, I can provide a general example using Python with NumPy for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Please let me know which option you are referring to, or provide more context for a more accurate response.
