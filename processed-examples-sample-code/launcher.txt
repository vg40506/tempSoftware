Use Case: Launcher helps in managing the execution of programs across different computing environments efficiently.

Code details and examples:
Launcher tool requires a configuration file as input to specify the tasks to be executed and their respective commands. Here is an example configuration file format:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: task1
    command: python script1.py input1.txt
  - name: task2
    command: ./executable2 -i input2.txt -o output2.txt
```

Once you have the configuration file ready, you can run the launcher tool using the command provided by the tool's documentation. For example:

```
launcher run config.yaml
```

This command will execute all the tasks specified in the configuration file concurrently or sequentially based on the settings provided.
