Use Case: GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) is a collection of command-line tools for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets, creating high-quality maps and plots.

Code details and examples:
1. Sample input file (data.txt):
```
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

2. Sample script to plot data points using GMT:
```bash
gmt psxy data.txt -R0/10/0/10 -JX10c -Sc0.3 -P -Ba -K > output.ps
gmt psbasemap -R -J -B -O >> output.ps
gmt psconvert output.ps -Tg -A
```

3. Command to run the script:
```bash
bash script.sh
```

Above commands will plot the data points from data.txt file using GMT, create a plot in output.ps, and convert it to output.png.

Please note that GMT provides a wide range of functionalities beyond this simple example.
