Use Case: LLVM is a compiler infrastructure project that is widely used in high-performance computing for optimizing code generation. 

Code details and examples:
LLVM supports various programming languages like C, C++, and Swift. Here is an example of using LLVM to generate an optimized assembly code from a simple C program.

```c
// sample.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, LLVM!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the C program using LLVM's clang compiler and generate LLVM IR code:
```bash
clang -S -emit-llvm sample.c -o sample.ll
```

To generate optimized assembly code using LLVM:
```bash
llc sample.ll -o sample.s
```

To compile the optimized assembly code:
```bash
gcc sample.s -o sample
```

To run the compiled executable:
```bash
./sample
```

This will output:
```
Hello, LLVM!
```
