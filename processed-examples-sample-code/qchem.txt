Use Case: Electronic structure calculations
Code details and examples: 
Q-Chem is a comprehensive ab initio quantum chemistry package that can perform electronic structure calculations for systems ranging from small molecules to large biomolecular complexes. Below is an example input file for a simple HF/6-31G calculation in Q-Chem.

Input file (input.inp):
```
$molecule
0 1
O
H 1 1.0
H 1 1.0 2 104.5
$end

$rem
jobtype = sp
basis = 6-31G
$end
```

To run the calculation, you can use the following command:
```
qchem input.inp output.out
```
