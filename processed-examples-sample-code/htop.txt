Use Case: Monitoring system resources with htop
Code details and examples:
htop is a popular interactive process viewer and system monitor for Unix systems. It provides real-time information on CPU, memory, and processes running on a system.

To run htop, simply open a terminal and type:
```bash
htop
```

This will launch the interactive htop interface showing system resource usage in a more visual and user-friendly way compared to the standard top command. You can navigate through the interface using the arrow keys and keyboard shortcuts displayed at the bottom of the screen.
