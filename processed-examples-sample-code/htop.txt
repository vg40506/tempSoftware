I see you mentioned htop, which is a popular interactive system-monitor process viewer. While it isn't as much an HPC software, I can provide information on how to run and use it.

Use Case: Monitoring system processes using htop utility
Code details and examples:
1. To install htop, please use the package manager specific to your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

3. You can navigate using the arrow keys and some important shortcuts include:
- F5: Sort processes
