Use Case: Creating a squashfs compressed filesystem.  

Code details and examples:
```bash
mksquashfs <source_dir> <output_file>.squashfs
```

In the above command:
- `<source_dir>` is the directory you want to compress into a squashfs filesystem.
- `<output_file>.squashfs` is the name of the output squashfs file.

For example, to create a squashfs filesystem from a directory named `myfolder` and save it as `myfolder.squashfs`, you would run:
```bash
mksquashfs myfolder myfolder.squashfs
```
