Use Case: Optimization tool   
Code details and examples:   
Symphony is an open-source solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. It is often used for various optimization tasks.   

Sample input file (in .mps format):   
```
NAME          EXAMPLE
ROWS
 N  OBJ
 L  ROW1
 L  ROW2
COLUMNS
         MARK0001  'MARKET'  ROW1                   1.0
         MARK0001  'MARKET'  ROW2                   1.0
         MARK0002  'MARKET'  ROW1                   1.0
         MARK0002  'MARKET'  ROW2                   1.0
RHS
     RHS1  'ROW1'                      2.0
     RHS1  'ROW2'                      2.0
BOUNDS
 UP BND1       'MARKET'                  1.0
 UP BND2       'MARKET'                  1.0
ENDATA
```

Command to run Symphony (assuming Symphony is installed and in the system path):   
```
symphony -F example.mps
```
