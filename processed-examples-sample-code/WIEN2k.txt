Use Case: WIEN2k
Code details and examples:
WIEN2k is a package for electronic structure calculations using the Full-Potential LAPW (Linearized Augmented Plane Wave) method. It is widely used in materials science and solid-state physics research.

Example input files for WIEN2k calculations:
1. Struct file (specifies the crystal structure):
```
NaCl
0.0
4.2 4.2 4.2
90 90 90
2
cart
0.0 0.0 0.0 Na
0.5 0.5 0.5 Cl
```

2. case.struct file (specifies the atomic positions within the unit cell):
```
2
REF= 4.2
SPIN UP/DOWN
Cl: 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000
Na: 0.50000 0.50000 0.50000
```

Command to run WIEN2k:
```bash
run_lapw -p
```

Note: WIEN2k requires a specific directory structure and additional setup before running calculations. Please refer to the WIEN2k user manual for detailed instructions.
