LSMS (Locally Self-consistent Multiple Scattering) is an electronic structure software package that uses the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) multiple scattering theory to calculate the electronic structure of materials. It is commonly used in the field of computational materials science.

Use Case: Electronic structure calculation with LSMS
Code details and examples:
Sample input file (input.in):
```
LSMS Calculation
30 30 30   ! Grid dimensions
1 1 1      ! Lattice constant
Fe          ! Element
1           ! Atom type
0.0001      ! Energy convergence criterion
```

Sample code snippet to run LSMS (assuming LSMS executable is lsms.x):
```
lsms.x < input.in > output.out
```
In this case, the LSMS calculation is performed using the input file "input.in" and the output is redirected to "output.out".LSMS does not use a standard input file format, and the parameters in the input file may vary depending on the specific calculation being performed.
