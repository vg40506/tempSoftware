Aspect is a 3D thermal convection and fluid dynamics simulation software used in geodynamics research. 

Use Case: Model convection in the Earth's mantle
Code details and examples:
```aspect
# Sample input file for convection simulation
subsection Materials
set Rock     Density 3300
set Rock     Viscosity 10^21
end

subsection Initial temperature model
set Initial temperature model Box
set Initial temperature model Domain 0 0 0 1000 1000 300
set Initial temperature model Minimum 1300
set Initial temperature model Maximum 1800
end
```
To run the simulation, use the command `aspect input.pr`.
