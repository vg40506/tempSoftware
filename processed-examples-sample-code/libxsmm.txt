Use Case: A highly optimized library for small matrix-matrix multiplications.

Code details and examples:
```
# Sample input file: input_matrix_A.txt
3 3
1.0 2.0 3.0
4.0 5.0 6.0
7.0 8.0 9.0

# Sample input file: input_matrix_B.txt
3 3
9.0 8.0 7.0
6.0 5.0 4.0
3.0 2.0 1.0

# Code snippet to perform matrix multiplication using libxsmm
import numpy as np
import libxsmm

# Load input matrices from files
matrix_A = np.loadtxt('input_matrix_A.txt', skiprows=1)
matrix_B = np.loadtxt('input_matrix_B.txt', skiprows=1)

# Perform matrix multiplication using libxsmm
result = libxsmm.xmm(matrix_A, matrix_B)

print(result)
```

Please note that libxsmm is a low-level library, and the code snippet above is a conceptual example. The actual usage may vary based on the specific implementation and configuration of libxsmm.
