Flask is a web framework for Python. 

Use Case: Creating a simple Flask web application
Code details and examples:
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

To run the Flask application, you can use the following command:
```
python app.py
```

This will start a development server and you can access the web application from your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
