Use Case: GaussView is a visualization program for computational chemistry calculations.

Code details and examples:
```bash
# Example input file: input.gjf (Gaussian input file)
# Sample content of input.gjf:
%chk=example.chk
# HF/6-31G opt

water optimization

0 1
O
H 1 0.96
H 1 0.96 2 104.5

# Example command to run Gaussian calculation and generate output file:
g16 input.gjf
```

Please note that GaussView is typically used in conjunction with Gaussian software for setting up jobs and visualizing output files.
