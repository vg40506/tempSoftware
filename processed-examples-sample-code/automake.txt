Use Case: automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files compliant with the GNU Coding Standards.

Code details and examples:
Automake requires a file named 'configure.ac' (or 'configure.in' for older projects) for input. Here is an example of a simple 'configure.ac' file:

```sh
AC_INIT([hello], [1.0], [hello@example.com])
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
AC_PROG_CC
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

To generate the Makefile.in file from the configure.ac file, you can run the following command:

```sh
$ automake --add-missing
```

This will create the Makefile.in file which can then be used with autoconf to generate the final Makefile.
