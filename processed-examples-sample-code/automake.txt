Use Case: Build and manage the configuration of a software project.

Code details and examples:
Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files from Makefile.am files. Below is an example of how to use automake:

**Sample input files:**
Makefile.am
```
bin_PROGRAMS = hello
hello_SOURCES = hello.c
```

hello.c
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Code:**
To generate the Makefile.in file using automake, you can run the following command in the directory where your Makefile.am is located:
```
$ automake --add-missing
```

This will generate the Makefile.in file based on the instructions in Makefile.am.
