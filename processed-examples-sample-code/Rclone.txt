Use Case: Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It supports various cloud storage services like Google Drive, Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc. You can use Rclone to copy, move, sync files between local and cloud storage.

Code details and examples:
1. List directories in a remote storage:
```bash
rclone lsd remote:path
```

2. Copy a file from local to remote storage:
```bash
rclone copy /path/to/local/file remote:path
```

3. Sync contents of a local directory to a remote directory:
```bash
rclone sync /path/to/local/dir remote:path
```

4. Mount a remote storage as a local file system (FUSE):
```bash
rclone mount remote:path /path/to/local/mount
```

5. Check for differences between local and remote storage:
```bash
rclone check /path/to/local/dir remote:path
```

6. Encrypt files before uploading to remote storage:
```bash
rclone copy /path/to/local/file remote:path --encrypt
```

7. Set up a new remote in Rclone:
```bash
rclone config
```

Note: Replace "remote" with the name of your configured remote storage, "path" with the path to the file or directory, and "--encrypt" with encryption options if needed.
