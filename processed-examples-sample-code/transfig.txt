As Transfig is a tool for converting FIG files created by xfig to other formats, I'll provide examples of how to use Transfig to convert a FIG file to different formats.

Use Case: Convert a FIG file to PNG using Transfig
Code details and examples:
```bash
fig2dev -L png input.fig output.png
```
In this command:
- `fig2dev` is the command for using Transfig.
- `-L png` specifies the output format as PNG.
- `input.fig` is the input FIG file to be converted.
- `output.png` is the output PNG file that will be created.

You can adjust the output format by changing the `-L` flag to a different format like `pdf`, `jpeg`, etc.

Use Case: Convert a FIG file to PDF using Transfig
Code details and examples:
```bash
fig2dev -L pdf input.fig output.pdf
```
In this command:
- `fig2dev` is the command for using Transfig.
- `-L pdf` specifies the output format as PDF.
- `input.fig` is the input FIG file to be converted.
- `output.pdf` is the output PDF file that will be created.

Just like before, you can change the output format to a different one by modifying the `-L` flag.

These commands assume that Transfig is installed and available in the system's PATH.
