Use Case: Internationalized Domain Names support library

Code details and examples:
libidn2 is a library that provides support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) according to the IDNA2008 specification. The library allows for the encoding and decoding of domain names containing non-ASCII characters.

Here is an example of encoding a domain name using the idn command line tool provided by libidn2:

```bash
echo "example.臺灣" | idn2
```

This will output the Punycode encoded version of the domain name "example.臺灣".

To decode a Punycode encoded domain name, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "example.xn--kprw13d" | idn2
```

This will output the UTF-8 representation of the domain name "example.xn--kprw13d".

The libidn2 library also provides APIs for developers to integrate IDN support into their applications.
