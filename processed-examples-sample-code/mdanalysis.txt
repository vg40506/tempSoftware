Use Case: MDAnalysis is a Python library to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories.

Code details and examples: 
MDAnalysis supports various input file formats for molecular dynamics trajectories such as DCD, XTC, TRR, etc. These trajectories can be loaded using the `MDAnalysis.Universe` class. Here is an example of loading a DCD trajectory file:

```python
import MDAnalysis as mda

# Load a DCD trajectory file
u = mda.Universe("topology.psf", "trajectory.dcd")
```

You can then access and analyze various properties of the system such as atoms, residues, coordinates, etc. For example, to calculate the center of mass of a group of atoms:

```python
# Calculate the center of mass of a group of atoms
protein = u.select_atoms("protein")
com = protein.center_of_mass()
print(com)
```

To run a script using MDAnalysis, you can simply execute it using Python. The above code snippets can be saved in a Python script (e.g., analyze_traj.py) and run using:

```
python analyze_traj.py
```
