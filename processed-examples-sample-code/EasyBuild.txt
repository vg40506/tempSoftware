EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework for building software packages in a structured, repeatable, and robust way. It aims to simplify the process of building software on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

Use Case: EasyBuild
Code details and examples:
1. Install a software package using EasyBuild:
- To install a software package like GCC using EasyBuild, you can create an EasyConfig file (e.g., gcc.eb) with the necessary details and dependencies. Here is an example content for the gcc.eb EasyConfig file:

```
easyblock = 'ConfigureMake'
name = 'gcc'
version = '9.3.0'
toolchain = {'name': 'gcc', 'version': '9.3.0'}
source_urls = ['https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/']
sources = [SOURCE_TAR_GZ]
source_md5 = 'xxxxxxx'
moduleclass = 'tools'

sanityCheckPaths = { 'files': ['bin/gcc'] } # Path(s) to verify with the sanity check, after installation

sanityCheckCmd = '${GCC_PREFIX}/${name}/bin/gcc --version'

modulefile = '''
setenv("EBROOTGCC", "${prefix}")
prepend_path("PATH", "${prefix}/bin")
'''

# dependencies
dependencies = [('GMP', '6.2.0'), ('MPFR', '4.0.2'), ('MPC', '1.1.0')]

```

- Next, run EasyBuild with the created EasyConfig file to install the software package:

```
eb gcc.eb
```

2. List available software packages using EasyBuild:

- To list available software packages that can be installed using EasyBuild, use the following command:

```
eb --search
```

This command will display a list of available software packages along with their versions that can be installed using EasyBuild.
