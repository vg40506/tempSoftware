Use Case: PMIx (Process Management Interface for Exascale)

Code details and examples:
PMIx is a process management library used in the HPC community for launching and managing parallel applications at scale. It provides an API for launching processes, exchanging data among processes, and managing process lifecycle.

To demonstrate the use of PMIx, we can provide an example where we launch a parallel application using PMIx API.

Sample Input File (input.txt):
```
4        # Number of processes
./myapp  # Application to run
```

Code:
```bash
pmixrun -n 4 ./myapp
```

In this example, we use the `pmixrun` command to launch a parallel application (`myapp`) with 4 processes. The PMIx runtime will handle the process management and communication among the processes.

Please note that the actual usage may vary based on the specific implementation of PMIx and the configuration of the system.
