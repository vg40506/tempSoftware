Use Case: Ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) allows users to analyze disk usage on the command line in a more interactive way.

Code details and examples:
1. To analyze disk usage of a specific directory:
   ```
   ncdu /path/to/directory
   ```

2. To scan a remote directory using SSH:
   ```
   ncdu ssh://username@remotehost//path/to/directory
   ```

3. To exclude specific directories from the scan:
   ```
   ncdu --exclude /path/to/exclude /path/to/directory
   ```

4. To save the scan data to a file for later analysis:
   ```
   ncdu -o output_file /path/to/directory
   ```

5. To analyze disk usage of the current directory:
   ```
   ncdu
   ```
