Use Case: Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is widely used in the field of computational materials science.

Code details and examples:
- Example input file for performing a simple ground-state calculation of Silicon using QE:
```bash
cat > si.in << EOF
&control
    calculation = 'scf',
    prefix = 'si',
    pseudo_dir = '/path/to/pseudo/',
    outdir = './'
/
&system
    ibrav = 2,
    celldm(1) = 10.2625,
    nat = 2,
    ntyp = 1,
    ecutwfc = 40.0
/
&electrons
/
ATOMIC_SPECIES
   Si  28.086  Si.pbe-mt_fhi.UPF
ATOMIC_POSITIONS crystal
   Si 0.00 0.00 0.00
   Si 0.25 0.25 0.25
K_POINTS automatic
  4 4 4 0 0 0
EOF
```

- To run the calculation using QE, you can use the following command:
```bash
pw.x -in si.in > si.out
```

This will perform a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation for the given Silicon input file.

Note: You need to have QE installed on your system and have the correct pseudopotentials in the specified directory to run this example.
