Use Case: SciPy is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It includes modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and more.

Code details and examples:

```python
# Example of using SciPy's optimization module (minimize function) to find the minimum of a function.
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define a simple function to minimize (e.g., Rosenbrock function)
def rosenbrock(x):
    return sum(100*(x[1:]-x[:-1]**2)**2 + (1-x[:-1])**2)

# Initial guess
initial_guess = [1, 1]

# Run the minimization
result = minimize(rosenbrock, initial_guess)

print(result)
```

To run the code:
```
python your_script.py
```
