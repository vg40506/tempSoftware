NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) is a software library developed by NVIDIA for high-performance communication in parallel computing environments. It is designed to leverage multiple GPUs within a single node for efficient data communication.

Use Case: Multi-GPU AllReduce
Code details and examples:
```python
import nccl

# Initialize NCCL communicator
comm = nccl.NcclCommunicator()

# Define input data
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Perform allreduce operation across multiple GPUs
output_data = comm.allreduce(input_data)

print(output_data)
```

Please note that the above code snippet is a simplistic example and may not reflect the actual implementation details. The command to run the code will depend on how you have set up your Python environment with NCCL support.
