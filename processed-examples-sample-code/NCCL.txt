Use Case: NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communication Library) is a library for high-performance communication primitives optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.

Code details and examples:
NCCL provides C and C++ APIs for collective communication operations such as all-gather, all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, etc. Here is a sample code snippet demonstrating the usage of NCCL in a CUDA C++ program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <nccl.h>

int main() {
    ncclComm_t comm;
    ncclCommInitRank(&comm, 2, ncclUniqueId, 1);

    float* data;
    cudaMalloc(&data, sizeof(float));

    // Execute an all-reduce operation
    ncclAllReduce(data, data, 1, ncclFloat, ncclSum, comm, cudaStreamDefault);

    cudaFree(data);
    ncclCommDestroy(comm);

    return 0;
}
```

The above code snippet demonstrates a simple CUDA program that initializes an NCCL communicator, performs an all-reduce operation on a float data array, and then destroys the communicator.

To compile the code, you can use the following command (assuming you have NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and NCCL installed):
```bash
nvcc -o nccl_example nccl_example.cu -lnccl
```

You can then run the executable by executing:
```bash
./nccl_example
```
