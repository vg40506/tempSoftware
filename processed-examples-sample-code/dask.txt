Use Case: Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing.

Code details and examples:
Dask can be used to parallelize operations across multiple cores or nodes in a cluster to handle larger-than-memory datasets efficiently. 

Here is an example of using Dask to load and perform operations on a large CSV file:

Sample Input File (data.csv):
```
name,age,salary
Alice,25,50000
Bob,30,60000
Charlie,35,70000
David,40,80000
```

Sample Code:
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Load the CSV file into a Dask DataFrame
df = dd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Perform operations on the Dask DataFrame
df['adjusted_salary'] = df['salary'] * 1.10

# Compute the result
result = df.compute()

print(result)
```

Command to run:
This code can be run using a Python interpreter.
