Use Case: Building and running containers with Charliecloud

Code details and examples:
1. Creating a container with Charliecloud:
You can create a container with Charliecloud using a Docker image. For example, you have a Docker image file called "myimage.docker" which you want to convert into a Charliecloud container.

```bash
ch-docker2tar myimage.docker myimage.tar
ch-tar2dir myimage.tar myimage/
ch-build myimage/ mycontainer/
```

2. Running the container:
After building the container, you can run it using the `ch-run` command, providing the path to the container directory and the command to run inside the container.

```bash
ch-run mycontainer/ /bin/bash
```

3. Mounting host directories:
You can also mount host directories into the Charliecloud container using the `--bind` option. For example, to mount the host directory "/path/to/hostdir" into the container directory "/containerdir":

```bash
ch-run --bind /path/to/hostdir:/containerdir mycontainer/ /bin/bash
```

4. Passing environment variables:
You can pass environment variables to the container using the `-e` option. For example, to set the environment variable "MYVAR" to "myvalue":

```bash
ch-run mycontainer/ /bin/bash -e MYVAR=myvalue
```
