Use Case: Cython is a programming language that makes it easy to write C extensions for Python.

Code details and examples: 
To use Cython, you first need to create a Cython file with a .pyx extension. Here is an example of a simple Cython file named `example.pyx`:

```python
def add_numbers(int a, int b):
    return a + b
```

To compile the Cython file into a C extension module, you can use the following command:

```
cythonize -i example.pyx
```

This will generate a `example.c` file and compile it into a shared object file that can be imported into Python. You can then use the Cythonized module in Python like this:

```python
import example

result = example.add_numbers(10, 20)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```
