Use Case: Hyperopt is a Python library for optimizing machine learning model hyperparameters.
Code details and examples:
Input file (example_hyperopt_input.py):
```python
from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp

# Define the objective function to minimize
def objective_function(params):
    return params['x']**2

# Define the search space
space = hp.uniform('x', -10, 10)

# Perform hyperparameter optimization
best = fmin(objective_function, space, algo=tpe.suggest, max_evals=100)

print(best)
```

To run the example_hyperopt_input.py file, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python example_hyperopt_input.py
```

Output:
```
{'x': 0.0014357768713279312}
```

This output represents the hyperparameter value that minimizes the objective function.

Note: This is a simple example to demonstrate the basic usage of Hyperopt. In real-world scenarios, the objective function and search space would be more complex.
