Use Case: Julia 

Code details and examples: 
Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing. Below is an example of a simple Julia code that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

```julia
# Define a function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n
function sum_numbers(n)
    return sum(1:n)
end

# Call the function with n=10
result = sum_numbers(10)
println("The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: ", result)
```

To run this Julia code, you can save it in a file with a ".jl" extension, for example, "sum.jl". Then you can run it from the command line using the `julia` command:

```
julia sum.jl
```

This will execute the code and output the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
