Use Case: HDF5 files created with the Parallel HDF5 library can contain a large amount of data and are commonly used in high-performance computing applications for storing and sharing large datasets efficiently.

Code details and examples:
1. Creating a sample HDF5 file using the h5py Python library:
```python
import h5py

# Create a new HDF5 file
file = h5py.File('sample_hdf5.h5', 'w')

# Create a dataset
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
file.create_dataset('dataset1', data=data)

# Close the file
file.close()
```

2. Reading data from an existing HDF5 file using h5py:
```python
import h5py

# Open an existing HDF5 file in read mode
file = h5py.File('sample_hdf5.h5', 'r')

# Read the dataset
dataset = file['dataset1']
print(dataset[:])

# Close the file
file.close()
```

3. Running an example code that uses Parallel HDF5 library:
```bash
mpirun -n 4 ./parallel_hdf5_example
```

Note: The code snippets provided above assume you have h5py installed in your Python environment. Also, the h5py library simplifies the process of working with HDF5 files in Python. The example code for Parallel HDF5 would need to be obtained from the specific application/library that supports its usage.
