Use Case: Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations.

Code details and examples:
1. Sample input file (data.txt):
```
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

2. In Octave, you can read this data file and perform operations like matrix multiplication as follows:
```octave
% Load data from file
data = load('data.txt');

% Perform matrix multiplication
result = data * data;

% Display the result
disp(result);
```

3. Command to run the script (assuming the code is saved in a file named "matrix_mul.m"):
```
octave matrix_mul.m
```
