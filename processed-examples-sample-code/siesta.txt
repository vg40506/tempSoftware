Use Case: Electronic structure calculations with SIESTA
Code details and examples:
SIESTA (Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations with Thousands of Atoms) is a software package for performing electronic structure calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). Below is an example input file for running a SIESTA calculation:

Sample input file (input.fdf):
```
SystemName       Sample Si crystal
NumberOfAtoms    2

%block ChemicalSpeciesLabel
  14  Si
  14  Si
%endblock ChemicalSpeciesLabel

%block AtomicCoordinatesAndAtomicSpecies
  0.0  0.0  0.0  1
  1.34 1.34 1.34 1
%endblock AtomicCoordinatesAndAtomicSpecies

%block kgrid
  6 6 6
%endblock kgrid
```

To run SIESTA, you would typically create an input file like the one above and then run the siesta executable with this input file. The command to run SIESTA may vary depending on your system setup, but a simple command to run SIESTA with the input file above could be:

```
siesta < input.fdf > output
```

This command will run SIESTA with the specified input file and write the output to a file named "output".

Please note that SIESTA is a complex software package with many options and parameters, so make sure to refer to the official documentation for more advanced usage.
