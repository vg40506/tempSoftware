Since LAPACK is a software library for numerical linear algebra, I can provide examples for using LAPACK functions in a programming language like Fortran or C. Below is an example of how to use LAPACK functions in Fortran.

Use Case: Solve a system of linear equations using LAPACK in Fortran
Code details and examples:
```fortran
program solve_linear_system
    implicit none
    
    ! Parameters
    integer, parameter :: N = 3, LDA = N
    integer :: info, i, j
    real*8 :: A(LDA,N), b(N), x(N)
    
    ! Initialize A matrix and b vector (example values)
    A = reshape((/1.0, 2.0, 3.0, &
                  2.0, 5.0, 2.0, &
                  3.0, 1.0, 4.0/), shape(A))
    b = (/5.0, 12.0, 9.0/)
    
    ! Solve the system of linear equations using LAPACK
    call DGESV(N, 1, A, LDA, ipiv, x, N, info)
    
    ! Print the solution vector x
    write (*, '(A)') 'Solution:'
    do i = 1, N
        write (*, '(F8.4)') x(i)
    end do
    
contains
    ! External LAPACK subroutine declaration
    external DGESV
end program solve_linear_system
```

In the above Fortran code snippet, we are solving a system of linear equations using LAPACK's `DGESV` subroutine. The `A` matrix and `b` vector represent the coefficients and constants of the linear system, respectively. The LAPACK subroutine `DGESV` solves the system and provides the solution vector `x`.

You would typically compile and run this Fortran code with a Fortran compiler that links against LAPACK libraries. The specific compilation and execution commands would depend on the compiler and LAPACK installation on your system.
