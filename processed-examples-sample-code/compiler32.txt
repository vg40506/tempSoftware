Use Case: Compiler32  
Code details and examples:  
Compiler32 is a hypothetical compiler software for a 32-bit architecture. Below is an example of how a C code file can be compiled using Compiler32.

**Sample input file (hello.c):**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, Compiler32!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Compilation command:**
```
compiler32 -o hello hello.c
```

In the above command:
- `-o hello` specifies the output file name as "hello"
- `hello.c` is the input C code file

After running the compilation command, an executable named "hello" will be generated, which can be executed to see the output "Hello, Compiler32!".
