I will provide examples for different software tools that have "map" in their name or related functionalities. 

Use Case: GNU Parallel
Code details and examples:
GNU Parallel is a command-line tool for running parallel jobs. It can be used to run multiple jobs in parallel on a single machine or on multiple machines. Here is an example of how you can use GNU Parallel to run a command in parallel:

Sample input file (input.txt):
```
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
```

Code:
```
cat input.txt | parallel echo Processing {}
```

Command to run:
```
parallel --jobs 3 < input.txt
```

Use Case: BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner)
Code details and examples:
BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome. Here is an example of how you can use BWA to align sequencing reads to a reference genome:

Sample input files:
- Reference genome: ref_genome.fa
- Fastq file with sequencing reads: reads.fq

Code:
```
bwa index ref_genome.fa
bwa mem ref_genome.fa reads.fq > alignment.sam
```

Command to run:
This command aligns the reads to the reference genome and outputs the alignment in SAM format.
```
bwa mem ref_genome.fa reads.fq > alignment.sam
```

Use Case: MapReduce
Code details and examples:
MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique for parallel data processing. Hadoop is a popular framework that implements the MapReduce model. Here is an example of how you can use MapReduce with Hadoop:

Sample input files:
- Input data file: input.txt

Code:
```
// Map function
function map(key, value):
    for word in value.split():
        emit_intermediate(word, 1)

// Reduce function
function reduce(key, values):
    emit(key, sum(values))
```

Command to run:
To run this MapReduce job using Hadoop, you would typically package your code into a JAR file and submit it to the Hadoop cluster.
```
hadoop jar your_mapreduce.jar input.txt output
```
