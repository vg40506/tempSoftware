Use Case: Image manipulation
Code details and examples:
Netpbm is a collection of image processing tools that can manipulate images in various formats such as PBM (Portable Bitmap), PGM (Portable Graymap), and PPM (Portable Pixmap).

Example of converting an image from one format to another:
1. Convert a PPM image to PGM:
```bash
ppmtopgm input.ppm > output.pgm
```

2. Convert a PGM image to PBM:
```bash
pgmtopbm input.pgm > output.pbm
```

3. Convert a PBM image to PPM:
```bash
pbmtojbg input.pbm > output.ppm
```

The input files should be in the specified format (PBM, PGM, PPM) and the output will be saved in the desired format.

To view more options and details, you can refer to the Netpbm documentation or use the `man` command for specific tool options.
