I am assuming you are referring to a high-performance file synchronization tool rather than the music group *NSYNC. Below is an example of using the popular file synchronization tool rsync:

Use Case: File synchronization with rsync
Code details and examples:
Sample input files:
- Source directory: /path/to/source_directory/
- Destination directory: /path/to/destination_directory/

Code to sync files from source to destination:
```bash
rsync -av /path/to/source_directory/ /path/to/destination_directory/
```

This command will synchronize the contents of the source directory to the destination directory. The `-a` flag preserves the file permissions and other attributes, while the `-v` flag enables verbose mode to see the details of the synchronization process.

Please note that this is just a guess based on the input "nsync". If you meant something else, please provide more context or clarify your question.
