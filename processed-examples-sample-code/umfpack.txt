Use Case: Solving sparse linear systems with UMFPACK

Code details and examples:

UMFPACK is a sparse direct solver package that can be used to solve large sparse linear systems efficiently. Here is an example of how you can use UMFPACK in MATLAB to solve a sparse linear system:

```matlab
% Define the sparse matrix A
A = sparse([1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [1, 2, 1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 1, 2, 1], 2, 3);

% Define the right-hand side vector b
b = [8; 6];

% Solve the linear system Ax = b using UMFPACK
x = umfpack(A, b);

disp(x);
```

In this example, `umfpack` is used to solve the sparse linear system Ax = b. The input matrix A is a sparse matrix defined using the sparse function, and the right-hand side vector b is defined as a dense vector. The result x is the solution to the linear system.

To run this code in MATLAB, make sure to have UMFPACK installed and properly linked with MATLAB. 

Please note that UMFPACK can also be used with other programming languages like C/C++ and Fortran. The process may vary depending on the specific language and environment.
