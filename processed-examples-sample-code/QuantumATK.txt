QuantumATK is a premium software package for atomic-scale modeling of materials, nanostructures, and devices. It is widely used in research areas such as solid-state physics, chemistry, and materials science.

Use Case: Electronic structure calculation
Code details and examples:

Input file format (example input file for DFT calculation):
```
# QuantumATK input file for DFT calculation
# Define the physical system
PhysicalSystem(
    name = "bulk_si",
    valence_electrons = 8,
    atomic_coordinates = [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.25, 0.25, 0.25]],
    elements = [14, 14],
    initial_spin_guess = [1.0, 1.0],
    k_point_sampling = MonkhorstPackGrid(4, 4, 4),
    k_point_interpolator = Kerker(epsilon=1.0e-6)
)

# Define the calculator (e.g., DFTB, ATK-DFT, etc.)
Calculator(
    name = "DFT",
    method = DFTB(
        k_point_sampling = {"path" : "automatic"}
    )
)

# Run the calculation
results = ATKCalculators.DFTB(bulk_si)
energy = results.total_energy
print(f"Total energy: {energy} eV")
```

Command to run the calculation:
```
quantumatk input.in > output.out
```
