Use Case: QuantumATK is a software platform for atomic-scale modeling of materials.

Code details and examples:
```python
# Sample input file for QuantumATK
# Input for running a DFT calculation on a molecule

# Define the molecule
molecule = Molecule(atoms=[Atom('C', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
                           Atom('O', [1.2, 0.0, 0.0])])

# Set up the calculator
calculator = LCAOCalculator(method=LCAO.HartreeFock, basis_set='3-21G')

# Set up the calculation
calculation = SinglePointCalculator(molecule=molecule, 
                                    calculator=calculator)

# Run the quantum calculation
output = calculation.run()

# Retrieve the results
energy = output.energy
forces = output.forces
```

To run the calculation, you would typically use the QuantumATK GUI or command-line interface with specific commands provided by the software documentation.
