Use Case: libepoxy is a library for handling OpenGL function pointer management. It simplifies the task of loading OpenGL functions.

Code details and examples:

To use libepoxy, you first need to include the epoxy/gl.h header file in your code, which will automatically handle loading the OpenGL functions for you.

Sample code snippet:
```c
#include <epoxy/gl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if (!epoxy_gl_version_compatible(4, 5)) {
        printf("OpenGL 4.5 is not supported.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Now you can use OpenGL functions without manually loading them
    glGenBuffers(1, &buffer);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

To compile the code including libepoxy, you can use a command similar to:
```bash
gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram -lepoxy
```

This will compile your program with libepoxy linked, so it can automatically handle OpenGL function loading for you.
